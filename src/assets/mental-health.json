It is hugely popular mostly because relatively non-technical users can generate an enormous range of studies with high precision.

Common modifiable risk factors for CVDs can be detected early and can be controlled by cost effective, widely available interventions.The major barriers to controlling these conditions in India and elsewhere are low detection rates, inadequate use of evidence based interventions and low adherence with these interventions. Common mental disorders such as anxiety and depression are frequently co-morbid with CVDs risk factors and often contribute to failure to follow treatment plans. Primary health care is the appropriate setting for improving the prevention and management of these chronic conditions.  Public Health Foundation of India  and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine will develop and evaluate an innovative mobile health (mhealth) software application, m-WELLCARE, which provides a patient health profile, decision support for clinical care, monitoring and feedback for use in Indian Community Health Centers (CHCs). This research will follow the steps proposed by the MRC for evaluation of complex interventions. Technical development of mwellcare will be conducted, user acceptability appraised and potential barriers overcome. m-WELLCARE will be evaluated in CHCs of Harayana and mini-primary health centers of Tamil Nadu. The use made of mwellcare, its impact on patterns of health care received and changes in risk factors achieved will be evaluated.

The discovery that PD follows Mendelian inheritance patterns in some families has led to the identification of PD associated genes. As sporadic and monogenetic Parkinsonism share important neuropathological and clinical features, notably the susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra to cell damage, insight into the function of disease causing gene mutations is expected to promote our understanding of key regulatory pathways involved in PD neurodegeneration. Mutations in the Fbxo7 gene have recently been linked to a complex, young-onset Parkinsonian syndrome. Little is known about the physiological role of the Fbxo7 protein or how mutations results in PD-associated neurodegeneration. The aim of my research project is to elucidate the signal transduction pathway of Fbxo7 utilizing standard and human-derived, patient-specific cell lines, but also by generating a new mouse model with human disease-associated knock in and conditional knock-out mutations of the Fbxo7 gene. It is hoped that the findings of the proposed project contribute to a better understanding of PD pathogenesis, the development of new treatment options and possibly the availability of a valid PD mouse model.", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "https://wellcome.ac.uk", "prefix": "360G-wellcome", "logo": "https://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/wellcome-logo-black.png", "name": "Wellcome Trust"}, "issued": "2018-03-21", "funders": [["The Wellcome Trust", "GB-CHC-210183"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-03-27T07:02:32+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "accessURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/grants-awarded", "downloadURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000xQ047AAC"}, "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2010-09-06T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2014-04-05T00:00:00+00:00"}], "awardDate": "2010-08-31T00:00:00+00:00", "Sponsor(s)": "Prof Doreen Cantrell", "amountAwarded": 227413, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "The Wellcome Trust", "id_and_name": "[\"The Wellcome Trust\", \"GB-CHC-210183\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-210183"}], "Region": "Scotland", "Approval Committee": "Neurosciences And Mental Health", "currency": "GBP", "title": "Wellcome Trust Clinical PhD Programme at the University of Dundee.", "Financial Year": "2009/10", "Applicant Surname": "Sammler", "Lead Applicant": "Dr Esther Sammler", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "PhD Training Fellowship for Clinicians"}], "id": "360G-Wellcome-093989_Z_10_Z"}

These will map out the social, intellectual and institutional origins of the new approach; its use in mediating industrial relations, the management of morale during the Second World War, urban planning, the organisation of mental health services and reconstruction of psychiatri c classification. Throughout the project, careful attention will be paid to issues of co-constitution, demonstrating how the tools of epidemiological investigation led to the development of new models of mental illness and personality, new assessments of clinical practice and new forms of political rhetoric and governmental action.", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "https://wellcome.ac.uk", "prefix": "360G-wellcome", "logo": "https://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/wellcome-logo-black.png", "name": "Wellcome Trust"}, "issued": "2018-03-21", "funders": [["The Wellcome Trust", "GB-CHC-210183"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-03-27T07:02:32+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "accessURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/grants-awarded", "downloadURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000xQ047AAC"}, "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2007-10-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2012-09-30T00:00:00+00:00"}], "awardDate": "2007-06-14T00:00:00+00:00", "amountAwarded": 211704, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "The Wellcome Trust", "id_and_name": "[\"The Wellcome Trust\", \"GB-CHC-210183\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-210183"}], "Region": "Greater London", "Approval Committee": "Medical History and Humanities Funding Committee", "currency": "GBP", "title": "Psychiatric Epidemiology and the Pursuit of Serenity in Modern Britain.", "Financial Year": "2006/07", "filename": "a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "Lead Applicant": "Dr Rhodri Hayward", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "University Award in H&SS"}], "id": "360G-Wellcome-082971_Z_07_Z"}

The project will also look into developments in mental health reform since the 1970s, the representation of the Basaglia movement i n film, literature and art and the fate of the ex-mental health asylums today (as ruins, as memory, as sites of forgetting).", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "https://wellcome.ac.uk", "prefix": "360G-wellcome", "logo": "https://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/wellcome-logo-black.png", "name": "Wellcome Trust"}, "issued": "2018-03-21", "funders": [["The Wellcome Trust", "GB-CHC-210183"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-03-27T07:02:32+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "accessURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/grants-awarded", "downloadURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000xQ047AAC"}, "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2011-09-12T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2013-09-11T00:00:00+00:00"}], "awardDate": "2010-08-31T00:00:00+00:00", "amountAwarded": 114271, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "The Wellcome Trust", "id_and_name": "[\"The Wellcome Trust\", \"GB-CHC-210183\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-210183"}], "Region": "Greater London", "Approval Committee": "Medical History and Humanities Funding Committee", "currency": "GBP", "title": "Franco Basaglia and Mental Health Reform in Italy,1960-2009.", "Financial Year": "2009/10", "filename": "a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "Lead Applicant": "Prof John Foot", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Personal Support: Inactive Scheme"}], "id": "360G-Wellcome-092690_Z_10_Z"}

The compounds will first be tested in steady state ATPase assays (Shimon et al; 2008) and an activity series assembled. Selected molecules would then be used in a chemical genetics screen against yeast CCT and ATP-site mutants in various of its subunits. Recent work in the Willison laboratory has led to an X-ray crystal structure for yeast CCT which is of sufficiently high resolution to guide the design of mutants. This will allow a level of understanding of this complex molecular machine which has not been achieved by any other approach. If time permits, the understanding gained of both the biology of CCT and the small molecules will be used to develop drug-like inhibitors of human CCT.", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "https://wellcome.ac.uk", "prefix": "360G-wellcome", "logo": "https://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/wellcome-logo-black.png", "name": "Wellcome Trust"}, "issued": "2018-03-21", "funders": [["The Wellcome Trust", "GB-CHC-210183"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-03-27T07:02:32+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "accessURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/grants-awarded", "downloadURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000xQ047AAC"}, "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2010-10-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2014-09-30T00:00:00+00:00"}], "awardDate": "2010-07-13T00:00:00+00:00", "Sponsor(s)": "Prof Paul Workman", "amountAwarded": 153466, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "The Wellcome Trust", "id_and_name": "[\"The Wellcome Trust\", \"GB-CHC-210183\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-210183"}], "Region": "Greater London", "Approval Committee": "Neurosciences And Mental Health", "currency": "GBP", "title": "ATP mimetics as inhibitors and probes of ATPases.", "Financial Year": "2009/10", "Applicant Surname": "Evans", "Lead Applicant": "Miss Lindsay Evans", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "PhD Studentship (Basic & Clinical)"}], "id": "360G-Wellcome-093988_Z_10_Z"}

My research project aims to translate these new state of the art quantitative proteomics methods in a clinical context and to compare results obtained in model human cell systems in the laboratory with changes observed in patient biopsy samples. Using model human cell lines, in which the expression of known tumour suppressor proteins and/or oncogenes can be modulated using small molecule inducers, the Lamond laboratory has identified human proteins which were previously unknown to be associated with mechanisms relevant to cell transformation. This includes the protein products of the human Formin 2 (FMN2) and MRFAP1 genes.

The treatment gap is vast, only 10% of people with MNS disorders in low-income countries access evidence-based treatments, compared to 33% in high-income countries [3]. Reasons for this include low awareness ofthe burden of MNS disorders and limited evidence to support development, adaptation and implementation of effective and feasible treatments. While pockets of mental health research excellence exist in Africa, MNS research capacity is generally limited, particularly in mental health intervention, service and system research. Mental health research excellence is currently undermined by restricted opportunities for training and mentorship, unclear career pathways, lack of integration in general medical settings, limited multi-disciplinary collaboration and the lack of a critical mass of MNS researchers and leaders. The overall goals of the African Mental Health Research Initiative (AMARI) areto build an African-led network of MNS researchers in Ethiopia, Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe, equipped to lead high quality mental health research programmes that meet the needs of their countries, and to establish a sustainable career pipeline for these researchers with the emphasis on integrating MNS research into existing programmes such as HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health. The objectives are to: 1. Select and train MNS research fellows from a range of disciplines at masters (n=25), PhD (n=20) and post-doctoral (n=6) levels in research excellence; 2. Build leadership skills of 26 fellows through adaptation of KCL Career Development Series on Leadership, Management and Mentoring; 3. Design and test an advocacy and systems change strategy for each country, aimed at building sustainable career pathways in MNS academia; 4. Develop a web-based support platform for training, supervision and networking. In year 1 we will undertake preparatory work to inform course development, thedesign of the advocacy and systems change strategy and gather baseline data for each country, for evaluation purposes, conducting qualitative and quantitative interviews with local policymakers and service users to identify needs and priorities through a theory of change map. We willtrain local supervisors, run pre-application workshops for potential applicants and assess existing training materials. . In years 2-5, fellows will begin higher degrees and courses as relevant. Trainingwill be mostly in Africa and using a) joint supervision by local and external supervisors with multidisciplinary expertise, b) taught modules in advanced MNS research methods, writing, and engagement with policy makers, and c) undertaking high priority MNS research. The underlying ethos of AMARI will be to ensure LMIC partner capacity is strengthened progressively towards self-sufficiency to ensure sustainability longer term. AMARI will be led by University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences (UZ-CHS). All consortium institutions will provide course facilitators and supervisors, with the Centrefor Global Mental Health (CGMH), University of Cape Town (UCT) and University College London (UCL) providing external supervision, research experts and materials for adaptation.
