, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "1091598", "companyNumber": "04365550", "description": "The Cirdan Sailing Trust was established in 1983 and has provided over 33,000 young people from the UK with self-development, integration and learning opportunities through the challenge of life at sea aboard our large sailing vessels. The focus of our service is on working almost exclusively with groups from youth organisations that work with young people whose lives are disadvantaged in some way. A sailing voyage takes the young people away from their geographical surroundings and removes them from their usual environment where they be may be subject to negative influences and other pressures that are detrimental to their development and well-being. Our sailing vessels provide them with a challenging, alien environment where they have to understand and accept authority, live and work as a team and be resilient. They are actively involved in every aspect of running and sailing the vessel. This includes deck work, planning and navigation, keeping watch, learn to cook for themselves and each other and keeping a tidy ship. As their voyage of discovery progresses, the young people learn to accept the disciplines and constraints of life on board and they face up to the challenges that produce the positive outcomes. The Trust is partly self-funding through the collection of voyage fees which, by careful management, are kept as low as possible. However, very few of the organisations and young people who wish to benefit from the experience we offer are in a position to cover the costs involved. They rely on support from our voyage of Discovery Fund scheme to supplement the limited monies raised through their own resources to ensure the experience can be made available to their young people. Most seasons, none of our groups can cover the full voyage fee so all have to supplemented through our Voyage of Discovery Fund scheme. We have always supported the majority of those who sail with at a level dependent upon their particular needs. Over the last few years, our support has risen from an average level of 40% to nearer 60%. We anticipate this trend will continue into the foreseeable future if we are to ensure our service is available to those who can most benefit. The experience we provide for young people makes a significant contribution to the development of their life skills, stimulates their desire to learn, improves their attitude towards authority and generally enhances their health and well-being. Whilst we are not in a position to provide a service for wheelchair users, as all participants do require a degree of mobility and coordination, we work closely with the youth leaders to tailor voyages to the needs of the young people in an effort to make the experience we offer inclusive. Together with the support we provide through our Voyage of Discovery Fund this allows us generally to work with young people from all areas of society irrespective of their culture, religion, attainment level, social standing or special needs. Throughout each season, we receive a great deal of feedback from the youth leaders who involve their young people in sailing residentials on board our vessels. The overriding view of these leaders in that the benefits gained from the experience are of enormous value, in particular with regard to the sense of achievement, self-confidence, and ability to face challenges. Very many of the young people who sail with us have restricted and insular view of life, often relying heavily on others to provide structure and organisation. The challenge off-shore sailing adventure with the rigidity of an on-board life allows the individual to develop naturally through the necessity of cooperation and the feeling of total inclusion as a valued member of the team. The leaders who accompany the young people are encouraged to discuss their desired outcomes with the Skipper prior to and during the voyage.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "1019915", "companyNumber": "02806113", "description": "Open Road is a registered charity with a strong and dynamic track record built up over 27 years. Our mission is to empower a diverse range of individuals, families and communities to lead healthy and more meaningful lives, free from addiction, offending behaviour and disadvantage, to ensure healthier, happier lifestyles. With over 100 staff and over 270 volunteers, we work across Essex from centres in Clacton, Colchester, Chelmsford, Harlow and Basildon and across Norfolk, Suffolk and Medway. We also operate outreach services at 28 different sites, working alongside families, carers, GP surgeries and hospitals. In 2016/17, over 10,500 people with drug and alcohol problems directly benefitted from the services we deliver. Open Road have been successfully working with drug users for over 27 years enabling individuals to break the cycle of addiction and get their lives, and those of their families, back on track and into recovery. Service users are able to access services through a number of ways, including self-referral, GP\u2019s, Criminal Justice agencies, housing associations, other voluntary organisations. As an organisation we embrace the \u2018no wrong door\u2019 philosophy. Working within local communities we are acutely aware of the problems that individuals and families face linked to substance misuse. Open Road staff and volunteers work daily with problematic drug users offering treatment and providing counselling, therapy, benefits and housing advice, debt management, creative activities and employment support. Through providing help with access to training, volunteering, education and employment opportunities, Open Road works to ensure that people fully re-integrate into society and ultimately attain a meaningful way of life. Open Road have run the Colchester SOS bus for 10 years and have recently taken part in a successful pilot to deliver an SOS service in Chelmsford. As a result of the pilot we will now be delivering the service on a permanent basis from April 2017. The SOS bus projects work to support the night time economy, and help to keep the town and city centres safe on weekend nights. The SOS Bus has a primary role to provide a safe haven for any vulnerable person, irrespective of their age, race, sexual orientation or religion. The services operate between 8:30pm and 4:00am every Friday, Saturday and Bank Holidays' Sunday nights in Colchester and Chelmsford Town and City Centres. It is the first point of contact for any person who is at risk. We provide medical and emotional support to anyone who gets into difficulty. The SOS Bus team provide support to those in need. Volunteers are in place to provide welfare support, respect confidentiality, and be a calming influence. Our volunteers directly help any visitors to the bus and if needed, will contact other services to provide further assistance. Volunteers support the on-board medics assisting them where needed. The SOS project provides a safe space for individuals and supports them in getting home safely without any issues. In the case of young people visiting the bus for assistance, our volunteers contact the young person's parents to reassure them that their child is safe and arrange for the young person to be collected or be safely dropped off at home. The SOS Bus also provides free bottles of water and medical care, as well as advice and information to visitors. The service proactively reduces the need to involve Police and Paramedics, and has significantly reduced the number of local A&E visits. The service also works in partnership with local businesses, pubs and clubs to ensure that the town centre is a safer place for weekend revellers. \u2003 In addition to our core substance misuse services, we run other projects including: The Essex Appropriate Adult service, ensuring that young people and vulnerable adults are supported through the police custody process. This project relies on our dedicated volunteer Appropriate Adults, who give their time free of charge to be available to support young people and vulnerable adults people in custody, ensuring that their welfare rights are adhered to at all times, 365 days per year from 7am to 11pm. Indeed this service has been so successful because of the dedication of our Appropriate Adults volunteers, we now provide an on call service between 11pm - 7am, 365 days per year for serious crimes. We provide a mentoring project in Norfolk and Suffolk, and a women's service in Essex in partnership with the Community Rehabilitation Companies, providing volunteer mentors to those who are part of the criminal justice system. Again, this project is driven by volunteers, supported by paid Service Coordinators, who mentor probationers allowing them to reintegrate into society, to ensure that they do not fall back into offending behaviour patterns. We provide counselling, anger management and drug and alcohol awareness training to the Military Correction Training Centre (MCTC). Our qualified counselling team support detainees who have recognised that they need help dealing with drug and alcohol issues or with anger issues. Detainees accessing this very successful service often come from difficult backgrounds or have had challenging upbringings, leading to these issues in adult life. Common feedback from the detainees is that they can't believe it took them being detained to receive the support they so desperately needed around the various issues they have struggled with. The success of this service has meant that, this year, we were awarded the new contract to continue to provide the service until 2019, having provided this service for the last 10 years. We provide a Young People\u2019s Drug and Alcohol services e in Medway both in the community and at HM YOI Cookham Wood. This service proactively helps and supports young people in the Medway area, who are experiencing various issues involving drug and alcohol abuse. The Medway team actively work with the local schools, undertaking visits and making presentations to the students, which has proved very successful in increasing student awareness of the dangers of drugs and alcohol misuse and leading to many young people accessing our services.", "name": "Open Road", "url": "http://www.openroad.org.uk", "id": "GB-COH-02806113", "id_and_name": "[\"Open Road\", \"GB-COH-02806113\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Adults (26 \u2013 65)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01022043", "name": "Tendring 014B", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-04-11T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2018-04-30T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 11}], "description": "To establish a Family and Carers Recovery Project in Clacton", "awardDate": "2017-03-24T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Advance people's physical and mental health, wellbeing and safety", "amountAppliedFor": 8400, "amountAwarded": 8400, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Family & Carers Recovery Project (Clacton)", "Primary beneficiary": "Carers", "Primary ethnicity": "White British", "Primary issue": "Caring responsibilities", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Yellow Car Charitable Fund", "code": "2016/17"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A436190"}

We do this through the following current initiatives: - Rainbow Services provides infrastructure support to local voluntary and community groups, holding regular meetings and publishing a weekly e-bulletin sharing information on subjects relevant to the sector, giving advice and guidance, delivering workshops on topics such as GDPR, and facilitating a voluntary sector hub with affordable room hire and office space. In 16/17 we sent 50 e-briefings out to over 200 organisations; - Rainbow Services also provides direct services to the local community via our Community Builder project, which is currently supporting local older residents. across Harlow who are socially isolated. This project uses an Asset Based Community Development approach to work with older people to develop sustainable social groups, supported by volunteers, and co-ordinate safety and health information sessions combined with social opportunities. In 16/17 over 900 older people were supported ; -Our Business Engagement project is working to facilitate a more structured approach to Corporate Social Responsibility and to create a better pipeline for business involvement and volunteering opportunities with the wider Voluntary Sector and local community, in partnership with Harlow Chamber of Commerce. Started in August 2017, the project has already engaged with 17 VCSE and 5 business organisations and is in the process of matching 6 volunteer opportunities; - Our Workshop project is a contracted arrangement (with Sodexo) to provide a workplace environment for offenders who have received a community service order through the courts in an environment that is, whilst punitive, also rehabilitative and constructive. This project is the only community and voluntary sector run programme which Sodexo offers in Essex and is creating real opportunities for offenders to give back to their community by building and refurbishing items for local groups and organisations, whilst developing transferable skills which could lead to more positive activities on completion of their order. In 16/17 we enabled the completion of 10,515 unpaid work hours and feedback includes \"I have learnt skills I didn't think were possible\"; - we also promote volunteering both internally and externally, and provide diverse volunteering opportunities within Rainbow Services, including intergenerational, reception, workshop, health programmes, and within communications. These opportunities have been used as springboards to paid employment for many of our volunteers, and for others who require supportive environments we have been able to facilitate learning and development through volunteering. In 16/17 2,984 volunteer hours were completed via Rainbow Services; - we pilot and test new ideas with partners. In previous years this has included a Health Navigation Project, which led to the subsequent development of Care Navigation in West Essex. Currently we are working with groups of VCSE organisations, local and district authority representatives, education providers, and community members to find solutions to youth mental health and youth inactivity in Harlow. In addition to this, in November and December 2017 we worked with Passmores Academy in a test programme they were running to tackle disengagement in education. They released 8 young people in Year 8 who were regularly being sent to the STEP (Students Towards Excellent Progress) team office into community activities, supported by the Alternative Provision Officer (Jo Busson). They tried several different activities, including intergenerational volunteering with Rainbow Services. It was found that the most successful elements of the programme were the intergenerational volunteering with Rainbow, where 2 young boys have continued to volunteer and 1 is considering it, and visits from ex-offenders to discuss their experiences. The young people were also better behaved and focused when doing practical activities which kept them busy. This has led to the development of this Workshop programme, which Passmores is supporting and which has been presented to the Safer Harlow Partnership, members of which have also approved the project and offered support.", "name": "Rainbow Services", "url": "http://www.rainbowservices.org.uk", "id": "GB-COH-03826440", "id_and_name": "[\"Rainbow Services\", \"GB-COH-03826440\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Young People (13 \u2013 18)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01021843", "name": "Harlow 004E", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-03-02T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2018-04-16T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2019-04-15T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 12}], "description": "To extend a recycling workshop project in Harlow to young people at risk of exclusion from school to increase their skills and life chances", "awardDate": "2018-02-14T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Improve life skills, education, employability and enterprise", "amountAppliedFor": 5360, "amountAwarded": 5308, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Rainbow Workshop - we are requesting funding to take the positive effects of our Workshop for offenders to young people disengaging from education and help them to learn new skills and positive behaviours through focused, mentored activity", "Primary beneficiary": "Children and Young People", "Primary ethnicity": "All Ethnicities", "Primary issue": "Education, learning and training", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Harlow Education Trust", "code": "2017/18"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A471926"}

Our aim is to have a sustainable project and as such in year two we aim to additionally offer an intermediate IT course.     Given that many of our service users have never used a desk top, a lap top or a tablet, it is necessary to first make individuals familiar with the hardware and allow them to feel comfortable around the equipment. It is vital to create a comfortable environment where individuals are not only attending to learn but attending to make friends and contacts who will become their external support networks. Support networks can prove vital in helping to support and encourage the educational progression of individuals and can lead to enhanced computer literacy skills, as often individuals will take their learning home, share their learning and therefore independently expand their learning.     By virtue of the project individuals will learn the skills to set up social network accounts and thereby stay in touch with family and friends via Skype, Facebook, and Twitter etc. Through our other projects we have learnt that some of our female service users who, for example, have had to leave their loved ones behind and seek refuge or asylum in this country often are devoid of any support, financial or otherwise. Therefore they may not have access to resources which enables them to stay in touch with their loved ones. This adds to their sense of isolation and exclusion in a country in which they know and have very little. This can and does affect their mental and physical health. Therefore, the ability to connect with loved ones not only breaks their sense of isolation/exclusion but can help improve their physical and mental wellbeing which is essential to their effective integration in societal life and in them exercising active citizenship.     Participants will learn to surf the net, to access educational websites; health websites; to type in and learn of what is happening locally so they can attend events and meet people. Additionally individuals will be encouraged and supported in making online applications for i.e. benefits; colleges; employment opportunities. They will be introduced to Microsoft word and will be taught how to write a document, save a document and print a document etc.     Emails are an instant and effective way of communication and participants will be assisted in creating email accounts, managing emails and will be encouraged to regularly email other participants of the project in order to build their confidence in communicating in this way.   Through the project our aim is not only to provide and develop digital skills and experiences but it\u2019s also to encourage excluded individuals and communities to access and benefit from educational, employment and training opportunities that will help break their sense of isolation and exclusion.", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:56:26+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000ngcxUAAQ.json", "file_type": "json", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "SCVO Digital Participation Challenge Fund and Charter Fund grants", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://scvo.org", "prefix": "360G-SCVO", "logo": "http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/themes/scvo/schemes/default/logo.png", "name": "Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations"}, "issued": "2017-07-21", "funders": [["Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations", "GB-SC-SC003558"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-02-05T14:14:27+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "SCVO Digital Participation Challenge Fund and Charter Fund grants", "accessURL": "https://scvo.org/transparency-open-data", "downloadURL": "https://scvo.org/digital/participation/charter-fund/projects/data.json"}], "identifier": "a002400000ngcxUAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-07-07T06:52:00+01:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2015-11-17", "dateModified": "2018-07-07T06:52:00+01:00", "endDate": "2016-11-15"}], "awardDate": "2015-11-17", "classifications": [{"vocabulary": "individuals-supported", "title": "Ethnic minorities", "code": "ethnic-minorities", "url": "https://scvo.org/digital/participation/charter-fund/projects?tag=ethnic-minorities"}], "amountAppliedFor": 7744, "amountAwarded": 7744, "fundingOrganization": [{"addressRegion": "City of Edinburgh", "charityNumber": "SC003558", "addressLocality": "Edinburgh", "location": [{"latitude": 55.945492, "longitude": -3.201152}], "description": "The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations is the membership organisation for Scotland's charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises.", "streetAddress": "Hayweight House, 23 Lauriston Street", "addressCountry": "Scotland", "department": "Digital", "postalCode": "EH3 9DQ", "name": "Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations", "url": "http://scvo.org", "id_and_name": "[\"Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations\", \"GB-SC-SC003558\"]", "id": "GB-SC-SC003558"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Crookston Community WWW Club", "dataSource": "https://scvo.org/digital/participation/charter-fund/projects/data.json", "filename": "a002400000ngcxUAAQ.json", "fromOpenCall": "Yes", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Digital Participation Charter Fund - Call 3", "code": "scvo-digital-charter-fund-call-3", "url": "https://scvo.org/digital/participation/charter-fund", "description": "Our Digital Participation Charter Fund, supported by by the Scottish Government, the ERDF and BT, invests in community digital participation projects across Scotland.

The support worker can provide a \u2018voice\u2019 for the client and due to the close one-to-one support provided are able to speak on their behalf if necessary with the client\u2019s approval. The service user will discuss with our support worker which activities they wish to undertake. ERCA provide support and transport so that clients are able to keep health and other appointments, which they may normally not be able to attend due to isolation or anxiety. They support them to go into the community for something as simple as buying food, clothes and pay bills thereby benefitting and empowering the service user to learn the necessary life skills to live independently. Our Activity Programme helps clients in maintaining their physical as well as mental health. ERCA have found that clients become more responsible for their own health and treatment when they are encouraged to attend these appointments regularly which leads to better and improved health. Weekly interaction between the support worker and client enables the support worker to monitor the client\u2019s illness and then feedback any change to the carer so that assistance can be organised quickly without the need for admission to hospital.

Many of the children have experienced trauma, bereavement, family breakdown, bullying, or have emerging mental health issues. These experiences/ disorders lead to emotional and behavioural difficulties, such as self-harm, substance abuse, risk-taking, truancy, anxiety, depression, aggression or withdrawal. As a result, young people struggle to engage with their education, families and communities; which in turn prevents them reaching their full potential. Without support, issues continue to disrupt children\u2019s education and risk escalating and continuing into adulthood. Kids Inspire create bespoke packages of support tailored to individual needs. Where it will benefit the child, we also support their parents and siblings. Services include the following: * Individual Therapy: including clinically proven counselling, Arts Psychotherapy, complementary therapies and talking therapy. *Group Work: including Lunch Club, Youth Forum, Dramatherapy and Filmmaking. *Mentoring: support and guidance on a one-to-one basis, provided by trained volunteers. *Coaching: supporting disadvantaged young people to improve their emotional health and mental wellbeing. Referrals come from local GPs, Primary/ Secondary/ Special Schools, EWMHS, Social Services, paediatricians, Health Visitors, Family Solutions teams, third sector agencies, and self-referrals. Kids Inspire empowers children and young people to make sense of their experiences and feelings to improve their emotional wellbeing. We achieve this by supporting service users to develop the knowledge and tools required to build resilience and coping mechanisms; enabling them to manage independently long-term.

This work will place BCP in a favourable position to reduce the stigma and discrimination that surrounds the subject of Mental illness and give us opportunities to inform a wider audience about the support available within their communities. Brentwood Community Tree In 2013, BCP set up The Brentwood Mental Health Providers Forum with the aim of working together with other mental health support agencies supporting people in Brentwood to provide and promote better mental health for residents. In 2015 the Forum became the Brentwood Community Tree Partnership. Led and managed by The Director of BCP, the partnership has worked together to create promotional materials and attend events and opportunities to promote the work of the organisations in the partnership.The Community Tree currently has 18 partner organisations and more waiting to join. Activities have included the design and production of 5000 \"Who can I turn to\" information leaflets, funded by Brentwood Council's Community Fund ( designed and produced by people in recovery from mental health illnesses at BCP), a presentation to GPs at a Time to Learn event, and to a patient engagement team.

Started in August 2017, the project has already engaged with 17 VCSE and 5 business organisations and is in the process of matching 6 volunteer opportunities; - Our Workshop project is a contracted arrangement (with Sodexo) to provide a workplace environment for offenders who have received a community service order through the courts in an environment that is, whilst punitive, also rehabilitative and constructive. This project is the only community and voluntary sector run programme which Sodexo offers in Essex and is creating real opportunities for offenders to give back to their community by building and refurbishing items for local groups and organisations, whilst developing transferable skills which could lead to more positive activities on completion of their order. In 16/17 we enabled the completion of 10,515 unpaid work hours and feedback includes \"I have learnt skills I didn't think were possible\"; - we also promote volunteering both internally and externally, and provide diverse volunteering opportunities within Rainbow Services, including intergenerational, reception, workshop, health programmes, and within communications. These opportunities have been used as springboards to paid employment for many of our volunteers, and for others who require supportive environments we have been able to facilitate learning and development through volunteering. In 16/17 2,984 volunteer hours were completed via Rainbow Services; - we pilot and test new ideas with partners. In previous years this has included a Health Navigation Project, which led to the subsequent development of Care Navigation in West Essex. Currently we are working with groups of VCSE organisations, local and district authority representatives, education providers, and community members to find solutions to youth mental health and youth inactivity in Harlow. In addition to this, in November and December 2017 we worked with Passmores Academy in a test programme they were running to tackle disengagement in education. They released 8 young people in Year 8 who were regularly being sent to the STEP (Students Towards Excellent Progress) team office into community activities, supported by the Alternative Provision Officer (Jo Busson). They tried several different activities, including intergenerational volunteering with Rainbow Services. It was found that the most successful elements of the programme were the intergenerational volunteering with Rainbow, where 2 young boys have continued to volunteer and 1 is considering it, and visits from ex-offenders to discuss their experiences. The young people were also better behaved and focused when doing practical activities which kept them busy. This has led to the development of this Workshop programme, which Passmores is supporting and which has been presented to the Safer Harlow Partnership, members of which have also approved the project and offered support.", "name": "Rainbow Services", "url": "http://www.rainbowservices.org.uk", "id": "GB-COH-03826440", "id_and_name": "[\"Rainbow Services\", \"GB-COH-03826440\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Seniors (65+)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01021843", "name": "Harlow 004E", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2017-12-05T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2018-01-02T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2019-04-30T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 15}], "description": "To help continue a Senior Safe and Social project for elderly people in Harlow", "awardDate": "2017-10-24T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Promote reduction of isolation and disadvantage and access to local services", "amountAppliedFor": 9000, "amountAwarded": 9000, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Senior Safe & Social", "Primary beneficiary": "Older People", "Primary ethnicity": "White British", "Primary issue": "Social inclusion and fairness", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Multiple Funding", "code": "2017/18"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A458975"}

Our work comprises a long-established volunteer home visiting service, offering emotional and practical help to families experiencing difficulties, alongside a range of family groups, well-being programmes, courses and events. What makes our charity special, is that all our trained volunteers have lived experience as parents/carers themselves. We believe in the power of community mobilisation, and so invest in local areas to support local families. Our Vision is: \u2018For every child and young person in Essex to grow up in a family that is strong, resilient and able to access the support they need; when and where they need it\u2019 HSE recognises that bringing up children can be hard work. All parents and carers will, from time to time, encounter problems which make the task harder. The key to success is for parents and carers to be strong and resilient, so they can meet challenges head on, and navigate their way through or around them successfully. Through mobilising hundreds of volunteers, we support families to help themselves, developing parenting skills and improving connections in their community. Our volunteers support families struggling with: \u2022 Mental Health issues (including peri/post-natal depression, etc.) \u2022 Financial hardship \u2022 Physical health issues \u2022 Single parenthood \u2022 Low self-esteem and confidence \u2022 Domestic abuse \u2022 Isolation \u2022 Routines and boundaries \u2022 Bereavement and other significant life events The main activities of HSE are as follows: \u2022 Home-Visiting service, led by volunteers \u2022 Family Groups \u2022 School Readiness programme (e.g. Big Hopes-Big Futures) \u2022 Peri/post-natal support groups \u2022 Targeted mental health and wellbeing programmes \u2022 Counselling \u2022 Volunteer training and recruitment \u2022 Information, Advice, Guidance (IAG) and signposting \u2022 Food Bank Voucher distribution \u2022 Family activity days Our main funders are The Big Lottery Fund, BBC Children in Need, Virgin/Banardo\u2019s PB-19yrs Contract, Essex Community Foundation, Clinical Commissioning Groups and local trusts. A new 5-Year Strategic Plan will be launched in March 2018 which will see HSE developing its funding streams to be more diverse; allowing the organisation to grow and build on excellent practice. Since April 2017, HSE has supported 368 families and 755 children, with over 200 trained volunteers offering 1,834 home visits, totalling 3,006 hours\u2019 time across Essex. 95% of all frontline delivery continues to be entirely volunteer led. It is currently estimated that over the course of one year, the value of HSE volunteer time will be over \u00a372,000 (ONS figures https://goo.gl/Uwz2cz). HSE measures impact across 14 individual areas of need (e.g. isolation, mental health, family conflict, etc.) with over 80% of families showing significant positive change. \u201cMy volunteer made a huge difference. Someone who\u2019s not going to judge and always took the time to stop and listen\u201d. We know that our model allows us to engage with those who would otherwise be considered \u2018hard to reach\u2019. Families frequently tell us the impact of a volunteer, giving their time freely, can be far more meaningful than a paid statutory professional. Isolation and mental health issues remain the top two concerns for most of the families we support, and this often means their ability to access mainstream services is limited. This provides HSE a unique opportunity to implement our proposed PICoD Project (Preventative IAG Co-Design) project; a three-year co-produced, family-led process that will develop a new model of information, advice and guidance (IAG). This will be aimed at those predominantly in the peri/post-natal period; a key period for those at risk of poor mental health and well-being. As an existing provider of peri/postnatal services in Harlow, and with a strong history of peer/ volunteer led practice, HSE are ideally positioned to lead on the project; building on our expertise and ability to engage families; ensuring that their voice is not only heard, but responded to in practical, real terms. HSE are confident that the project is deliverable as commitment has been tested with partners (e.g. Virgin/Banardo\u2019s and University of Essex (UofE)) who say objectives are both realistic and achievable. By drawing on our existing network of partners, and engagement with families, HSE are keen to shape the future of family led practice. We believe this is achievable by harnessing the voices and opinions of service users as a tool; to shape and influence the way in which future information, advice and service delivery is commissioned. At HSE, our approach to project design, development and delivery is thorough and systematic. At concept stage, HSE appoints a Project Lead and a Project Delivery Team to draft delivery plans (in a standard format) and undertake initial research. This involves liaising with stakeholders (staff, service users, potential funders and partners, etc.); testing project feasibility; identifying resource needs; establishing project milestones/dependencies/budgets; and undertaking SWOT analysis. This forms the foundation for funding applications/development, as part of the new 2018 Funding Strategy. Upon funding success, our Development Team hands over to the Project Delivery Team, who refine proposals and manage the initiative on an ongoing basis, reporting back to Management, Trustees and Funders in a structured way.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "1170940", "companyNumber": "10348139", "description": "Home-Start Essex (HSE) is a leading family support charity based in Essex working to achieve healthy and positive outcomes for children and families. Our work comprises a long-established volunteer home visiting service, offering emotional and practical help to families experiencing difficulties, alongside a range of family groups, well-being programmes, courses and events. What makes our charity special, is that all our trained volunteers have lived experience as parents/carers themselves. We believe in the power of community mobilisation, and so invest in local areas to support local families. Our Vision is: \u2018For every child and young person in Essex to grow up in a family that is strong, resilient and able to access the support they need; when and where they need it\u2019 HSE recognises that bringing up children can be hard work. All parents and carers will, from time to time, encounter problems which make the task harder. The key to success is for parents and carers to be strong and resilient, so they can meet challenges head on, and navigate their way through or around them successfully. Through mobilising hundreds of volunteers, we support families to help themselves, developing parenting skills and improving connections in their community. Our volunteers support families struggling with: \u2022 Mental Health issues (including peri/post-natal depression, etc.) \u2022 Financial hardship \u2022 Physical health issues \u2022 Single parenthood \u2022 Low self-esteem and confidence \u2022 Domestic abuse \u2022 Isolation \u2022 Routines and boundaries \u2022 Bereavement and other significant life events The main activities of HSE are as follows: \u2022 Home-Visiting service, led by volunteers \u2022 Family Groups \u2022 School Readiness programme (e.g. Big Hopes-Big Futures) \u2022 Peri/post-natal support groups \u2022 Targeted mental health and wellbeing programmes \u2022 Counselling \u2022 Volunteer training and recruitment \u2022 Information, Advice, Guidance (IAG) and signposting \u2022 Food Bank Voucher distribution \u2022 Family activity days Our main funders are The Big Lottery Fund, BBC Children in Need, Virgin/Banardo\u2019s PB-19yrs Contract, Essex Community Foundation, Clinical Commissioning Groups and local trusts. A new 5-Year Strategic Plan will be launched in March 2018 which will see HSE developing its funding streams to be more diverse; allowing the organisation to grow and build on excellent practice. Since April 2017, HSE has supported 368 families and 755 children, with over 200 trained volunteers offering 1,834 home visits, totalling 3,006 hours\u2019 time across Essex. 95% of all frontline delivery continues to be entirely volunteer led. It is currently estimated that over the course of one year, the value of HSE volunteer time will be over \u00a372,000 (ONS figures https://goo.gl/Uwz2cz). HSE measures impact across 14 individual areas of need (e.g. isolation, mental health, family conflict, etc.) with over 80% of families showing significant positive change. \u201cMy volunteer made a huge difference. Someone who\u2019s not going to judge and always took the time to stop and listen\u201d. We know that our model allows us to engage with those who would otherwise be considered \u2018hard to reach\u2019. Families frequently tell us the impact of a volunteer, giving their time freely, can be far more meaningful than a paid statutory professional. Isolation and mental health issues remain the top two concerns for most of the families we support, and this often means their ability to access mainstream services is limited. This provides HSE a unique opportunity to implement our proposed PICoD Project (Preventative IAG Co-Design) project; a three-year co-produced, family-led process that will develop a new model of information, advice and guidance (IAG). This will be aimed at those predominantly in the peri/post-natal period; a key period for those at risk of poor mental health and well-being. As an existing provider of peri/postnatal services in Harlow, and with a strong history of peer/ volunteer led practice, HSE are ideally positioned to lead on the project; building on our expertise and ability to engage families; ensuring that their voice is not only heard, but responded to in practical, real terms. HSE are confident that the project is deliverable as commitment has been tested with partners (e.g. Virgin/Banardo\u2019s and University of Essex (UofE)) who say objectives are both realistic and achievable. By drawing on our existing network of partners, and engagement with families, HSE are keen to shape the future of family led practice. We believe this is achievable by harnessing the voices and opinions of service users as a tool; to shape and influence the way in which future information, advice and service delivery is commissioned. At HSE, our approach to project design, development and delivery is thorough and systematic. At concept stage, HSE appoints a Project Lead and a Project Delivery Team to draft delivery plans (in a standard format) and undertake initial research. This involves liaising with stakeholders (staff, service users, potential funders and partners, etc.); testing project feasibility; identifying resource needs; establishing project milestones/dependencies/budgets; and undertaking SWOT analysis. This forms the foundation for funding applications/development, as part of the new 2018 Funding Strategy. Upon funding success, our Development Team hands over to the Project Delivery Team, who refine proposals and manage the initiative on an ongoing basis, reporting back to Management, Trustees and Funders in a structured way.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"name": "Lads Need Dads CIC", "description": "Who we are: Lads Need Dads CIC is a Not-For-Profit Community Interest Company, based in Tendring, North East Essex, set up to prevent potential problems and address existing ones where boys are missing a father figure in their lives. Our Mission: To empower and enable boys aged 11-15 with absent fathers or limited access to a male role model, to be motivated, responsible, capable, resilient and emotionally competent to prevent them from coming at risk of under achieving, offending, exclusion or dropping out of school. What we do: \u2022 Help boys through male-led group mentoring, to cope with problems and issues faced at home and school, and explore the important choices they face in their adolescent development, to prevent escalation of negative behaviour. \u2022 Provide boys with opportunities for adventure, to be tested and challenged, both physically and mentally. \u2022 Provide boys with practical life-skill training, community volunteering and peer mentoring opportunities. \u2022 Raise awareness and understanding of the important role fathers play in the emotional, mental and educational development and well-being of boys. Why we do it: In 2013 the Centre for Social Justice published Fractured Families: Why stability matters, which highlighted an alarming trend of fatherlessness across the UK. It found that a teenager sitting their GCSEs is more likely to own a smartphone than live with their father, (only 57 per cent of 15-year olds are still living with their fathers while 62 per cent own a smartphone), (1). Nationally almost one quarter of families with dependent children are lone-parent families. (2) This figure rises significantly in our poorest neighbourhoods, and can be as high as 75 percent. (3) Blanden (2006) (4), found a father\u2019s low interest in his son\u2019s education, for instance, reduces his boy\u2019s chances of escaping poverty by 25% and at the more extreme end, 76% of all male prisoners in England and Wales had an absent father. Statistically males are the more vulnerable gender when it comes to alcohol and drug misuse, victims of murder, victims of suicide, homelessness. Lads Need Dads was set up to provide a preventative and early-intervention response to an ever-increasing social issue. Our services: \u2018EQUIP\u2019, is a six-month self-development group-work programme held in school including bush-craft and outdoor activities supported by a facilitator and a team of male mentors. Equips\u2019 aim is to help boys cope with problems and issues faced at home and school, and explore the important choices they face in their adolescent development, to prevent escalation of negative behaviour. Engage, a practical life-skill and community volunteering programme follows Equip and takes place in the community for six-months and involves boys attending practical life-skill workshops and together with thier mentors, doing voluntary work for lone parents, pensioners and people with a disability within their local community. Jobs include, DIY, painting and decorating, gardening, shed building, etc. Inspire, a peer mentoring programme incorporating inspirational speakers and visits to inspiring places, completes the 18-month programme. We have run the 18-month pilot once through between March 2016 and August 2017 with excellent outcomes. We started another Equip Programme in May this year. This ended this month (Nov) and the boys off this programme are now attending Engage, the second part of the programme. Alongside the programme we provide on-going support for mums and carers via workshops, coffee mornings and a face-book support group. We raise awareness within the community by giving talks and presentations to community groups, attending public events etc. We run an open-ended check-in group for graduates of the programme one evening a month to keep the arm of support in place, should they need it. We run a fishing club in the summer which is open to any boy on the programme, graduate or new boy who fits our criteria. We are just about to start a guitar club for boys who want to learn to play the guitar but who can't afford lessons. All our services are provided free of charge. We have a growing team of 14 male volunteer male mentors, between the ages of 29 and 70, from a wide range of backgrounds and from the local community. Our Director board is made up of four professionals from education, social care, statutory services and the voluntary sector. We are just entering into our next round of recruitment so anticipate our volunteer numbers increasing.

Resuscitation delivered through early goal directed therapy (EGDT) has shown a relative mortality reduction from adult sepsis in developed countries by 25% (Absolute Reduction 9%). We hypothesise that early resuscitation of adults with suspected ABM, using an EGDT bundle of interventions which are appropriate for resource limited settings, will significantly improve immediate and long term survival. Key goals: 1. We will test the bundle in a before/after study with sequentially phased prospective control and intervention groups in the new Wellcome Trust supported adult emergency and trauma centre (AETC) at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The bundle will include nurse led rapid assessment and triage and targeted delivery of resuscitation to all subjects with suspected ABM using clear, achievable goal directed targets. Subjects will be excluded retrospectively if an alternative diagnosis is made subsequently. 2.

The project will enhance their basic electronic communication skills and improve their social network skills.    The project will be delivered in Glasgow at the Reach premises. The beneficiaries are EM women mainly from a South Asian background.    1. In order to achieve the above aims Reach will, first of all, update the current website to make it more interactive.  This process will involve   a) creating an electronic booking system for the walking groups (5 walking groups with 64 members).  b) Mental Health counselling booking system to help clients book and cancel their appointments, to help counsellors manage their sessions and counselling partners (GP surgeries) access client progress.    c) Integrate Facebook, Twitter and Youtube into the Reach website.    2. Concurrently, Reach key staff will receive training on basic management and operation of the interactive sections of the website (external trainers)    3) Organise and deliver 8 workshops of 2 hours each with up to 10 participants in each group to help understand and use the interactive part of the Reach website and general use of social media including group text messaging such as Whatsapp.     4) The workshops will be complemented with hands on experience on using social media tools and using the Reach interactive website booking system.  This will involve 2 sessions of 1 hour each per individual with 5 in a group benefiting 80 individuals.  The practical sessions will be delivered at 2 libraries i.e. Govanhill Library and Ibrox Library.  The practical sessions will be delivered by Reach staff who are trained through external trainers (as mentioned). In addition to the set programmes above the service users will have the opportunity to contact Reach staff if they need support after the delivery of the project.    The proposed project is innovative in a sense that it has specific and predetermined areas to improve and digitise a specific group of EM individuals including service users. It will bring in external partners and make use of existing resources thereby providing better value for money (use of libraries for I.T. service plus the space for workshops).    The other innovative part is that it helps build the technological skills for up to 80 EM individuals in order to not just help their skills but also to help use Reach services (Mental Health Counselling, Employability, Health Walks). The project will build long term knowledge and skills about social media which will help them in future or to engage with others in the community including being able to access services from different agencies. The project also has a long term benefit i.e. by Reach being able to continue to help the service users in electronic engagement.", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:56:26+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000ngcxUAAQ.json", "file_type": "json", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "SCVO Digital Participation Challenge Fund and Charter Fund grants", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://scvo.org", "prefix": "360G-SCVO", "logo": "http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/themes/scvo/schemes/default/logo.png", "name": "Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations"}, "issued": "2017-07-21", "funders": [["Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations", "GB-SC-SC003558"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-02-05T14:14:27+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "SCVO Digital Participation Challenge Fund and Charter Fund grants", "accessURL": "https://scvo.org/transparency-open-data", "downloadURL": "https://scvo.org/digital/participation/charter-fund/projects/data.json"}], "identifier": "a002400000ngcxUAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-07-07T06:52:00+01:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2015-11-16", "dateModified": "2018-07-07T06:52:00+01:00", "endDate": "2016-11-11"}], "awardDate": "2015-11-16", "classifications": [{"vocabulary": "individuals-supported", "title": "Ethnic minorities", "code": "ethnic-minorities", "url": "https://scvo.org/digital/participation/charter-fund/projects?tag=ethnic-minorities"}], "amountAppliedFor": 9594, "amountAwarded": 9594, "fundingOrganization": [{"addressRegion": "City of Edinburgh", "charityNumber": "SC003558", "addressLocality": "Edinburgh", "location": [{"latitude": 55.945492, "longitude": -3.201152}], "description": "The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations is the membership organisation for Scotland's charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises.", "streetAddress": "Hayweight House, 23 Lauriston Street", "addressCountry": "Scotland", "department": "Digital", "postalCode": "EH3 9DQ", "name": "Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations", "url": "http://scvo.org", "id_and_name": "[\"Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations\", \"GB-SC-SC003558\"]", "id": "GB-SC-SC003558"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Ethnicity & Social Media: A Digital Way Forward", "dataSource": "https://scvo.org/digital/participation/charter-fund/projects/data.json", "filename": "a002400000ngcxUAAQ.json", "fromOpenCall": "Yes", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Digital Participation Charter Fund - Call 3", "code": "scvo-digital-charter-fund-call-3", "url": "https://scvo.org/digital/participation/charter-fund", "description": "Our Digital Participation Charter Fund, supported by by the Scottish Government, the ERDF and BT, invests in community digital participation projects across Scotland.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "1146149", "description": "Contact the Elderly is dedicated to relieving the acute loneliness and isolation of older people aged 75 and over who live alone, without family, friends or other support networks nearby. We meet this need with a simple yet effective model: free, monthly tea parties for small groups of older people and volunteers within their community. Our model is a sustainable and scalable solution for the prevention and reduction of loneliness and social isolation providing strong and tangible outcomes for older people. It also provides opportunities to a large number of volunteers, providing them with training and development. Our work is rooted in local communities and led by volunteer group coordinators. By working closely with older people, many of whom enjoy our service for up to a decade, we understand how loneliness impacts on wellbeing, which helps to inform our work and plan our activities. We work with older people through key transition points in their lives and signpost to other services. We operate our model in the following ways: \u2022 Community groups: These take place on a Sunday when other services are unavailable and considered the loneliest day of the week for many. These groups form the core of our work. \u2022 University groups: This is a developing area of activity. Hosted by students, these aim to develop intergenerational relationships and raise awareness of the issues of isolation and loneliness in older people. \u2022 Special Interest Groups: These groups are offshoots of existing tea party groups and involve the interests of members. Examples include museums hosting tea parties and men only groups. \u2022 GP Groups: These groups are run by patient participation groups alongside GP\u2019s. This is our newest area of work and we currently run 12 groups in the UK. Our target beneficiaries are isolated and lonely older people age 75+ living alone. In some areas of the UK, the target age group is 68-70 to account for lower life expectancies. Loneliness and isolation can have a devastating effect on mental health and wellbeing, impacting on physical health. The majority of those using our services fall into the 'oldest old' category; almost half (45%) of those attending tea parties are in their 80s, while 19% are in their 90s and 1% are over 100. Many have social care needs including mobility problems, hearing problems and visual impairment. Over two thirds (69%) of our older guests only receive visits from anyone other than a paid carer, just once a week or less. Almost half (44%)do not know their neighbours. For many of our older guests the tea party is the only social outing they attend each month. Some five million older people say TV is their main form of company. Loneliness can have a greater effect on overall health than obesity and heart disease. Lonely people drink more often and are prone to early admission to residential care. Loneliness and social isolation are considered as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day*. Up to one in ten patients a day visit their GP because they are lonely. Global AgeWatch Index research published in Sept 2015 states that 1 in 10 older people describe themselves as being lonely often or all the time. Survey results recently published by The Jo Cox Commission on loneliness suggest this figure is even higher and that almost three-quarters of older people in the UK are lonely and more than half of those have never spoken to anyone about how they feel. Local authority services enabling people to maintain social networks have diminished or escalated significantly in cost, thus the essential roles monitoring welfare and early intervention support have significantly reduced for many older people. Tea parties create inter-generational friendships and often involve whole families. Many guests and volunteers form strong friendships and networks develop around guests, providing informal monitoring of their welfare and contact outside of tea parties. We collect regular feedback and comments from guests, volunteers and referrers. Independent research carried out in 2016 amongst 700 older guests confirmed that the charity\u2019s tea parties significantly relieve feelings of isolation and loneliness. This increases wellbeing and research showed as a direct result of tea parties we are meeting our outcomes: \u2022 77% feel happier because of tea parties \u2022 40% of our guests said that their physical or mental health has improved as a result of the tea parties \u2022 95% said they have something to look forward to \u2022 63% feel part of a community \u2022 90% have made friends with volunteers and 81% with other guests. Volunteers work within their communities and their views and ideas are invaluable to us: \u2022 23% of our volunteers have been with Contact the Elderly for between 6-40 years and 50% for between 1-5 years. \u2022 21% heard about us through 'word of mouth' and 13% through local newspapers indicating our reach within communities. \u2022 84% said their primary motivation for volunteers was 'wanting to help isolated and lonely older people' and Contact the Elderly provides them with regular opportunities to do this. Because our groups meet at the weekends, those who work and those that volunteers that also experience loneliness at the weekend particularly benefit. The third biggest reason for volunteering was 'feeling closer to my local community' with 22% of respondents citing this reason. \u2022 30% of our volunteers also volunteer for very local organisations and provide vital links between Contact the Elderly and these groups. There is great value to volunteering within the communities we work in and of our volunteers: \u2022 92% said 'I feel I am giving something back' \u2022 77% said 'I am more aware of the issues facing older people' \u2022 77% said 'I have made friends with an older person' \u2022 71% said 'I feel a part of the community I live in' \u2022 93% said they felt equipped by Contact the Elderly to help the older guests.", "name": "Contact The Elderly", "url": "http://www.contact-the-elderly.org.uk", "id": "GB-CHC-1146149", "id_and_name": "[\"Contact the Elderly Limited\", \"GB-CHC-1146149\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Seniors (65+)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01021544", "name": "Chelmsford 008A", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-03-23T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2018-01-31T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2019-01-31T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 12}], "description": "To establish a new Group in Chelmsford lead by volunteers, providing monthly tea parties for isolated and lonely older people", "awardDate": "2018-02-06T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Advance people's physical and mental health, wellbeing and safety", "amountAppliedFor": 5000, "amountAwarded": 5000, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Chelmsford group", "Primary beneficiary": "Older People", "Primary ethnicity": "All Ethnicities", "Primary issue": "Health, wellbeing and serious illness", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Provide Foundation", "code": "2017/18"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A462117"}
, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "1019915", "companyNumber": "02806113", "description": "Open Road is a registered charity with a strong and dynamic track record built up over 27 years. Our mission is to empower a diverse range of individuals, families and communities to lead healthy and more meaningful lives, free from addiction, offending behaviour and disadvantage, to ensure healthier, happier lifestyles. With over 100 staff and over 270 volunteers, we work across Essex from centres in Clacton, Colchester, Chelmsford, Harlow and Basildon and across Norfolk, Suffolk and Medway. We also operate outreach services at 28 different sites, working alongside families, carers, GP surgeries and hospitals. In 2016/17, over 10,500 people with drug and alcohol problems directly benefitted from the services we deliver. Open Road have been successfully working with drug users for over 27 years enabling individuals to break the cycle of addiction and get their lives, and those of their families, back on track and into recovery. Service users are able to access services through a number of ways, including self-referral, GP\u2019s, Criminal Justice agencies, housing associations, other voluntary organisations. As an organisation we embrace the \u2018no wrong door\u2019 philosophy. Working within local communities we are acutely aware of the problems that individuals and families face linked to substance misuse. Open Road staff and volunteers work daily with problematic drug users offering treatment and providing counselling, therapy, benefits and housing advice, debt management, creative activities and employment support. Through providing help with access to training, volunteering, education and employment opportunities, Open Road works to ensure that people fully re-integrate into society and ultimately attain a meaningful way of life. Open Road have run the Colchester SOS bus for 10 years and have recently taken part in a successful pilot to deliver an SOS service in Chelmsford. As a result of the pilot we will now be delivering the service on a permanent basis from April 2017. The SOS bus projects work to support the night time economy, and help to keep the town and city centres safe on weekend nights. The SOS Bus has a primary role to provide a safe haven for any vulnerable person, irrespective of their age, race, sexual orientation or religion. The services operate between 8:30pm and 4:00am every Friday, Saturday and Bank Holidays' Sunday nights in Colchester and Chelmsford Town and City Centres. It is the first point of contact for any person who is at risk. We provide medical and emotional support to anyone who gets into difficulty. The SOS Bus team provide support to those in need. Volunteers are in place to provide welfare support, respect confidentiality, and be a calming influence. Our volunteers directly help any visitors to the bus and if needed, will contact other services to provide further assistance. Volunteers support the on-board medics assisting them where needed. The SOS project provides a safe space for individuals and supports them in getting home safely without any issues. In the case of young people visiting the bus for assistance, our volunteers contact the young person's parents to reassure them that their child is safe and arrange for the young person to be collected or be safely dropped off at home. The SOS Bus also provides free bottles of water and medical care, as well as advice and information to visitors. The service proactively reduces the need to involve Police and Paramedics, and has significantly reduced the number of local A&E visits. The service also works in partnership with local businesses, pubs and clubs to ensure that the town centre is a safer place for weekend revellers. \u2003 In addition to our core substance misuse services, we run other projects including: The Essex Appropriate Adult service, ensuring that young people and vulnerable adults are supported through the police custody process. This project relies on our dedicated volunteer Appropriate Adults, who give their time free of charge to be available to support young people and vulnerable adults people in custody, ensuring that their welfare rights are adhered to at all times, 365 days per year from 7am to 11pm. Indeed this service has been so successful because of the dedication of our Appropriate Adults volunteers, we now provide an on call service between 11pm - 7am, 365 days per year for serious crimes. We provide a mentoring project in Norfolk and Suffolk, and a women's service in Essex in partnership with the Community Rehabilitation Companies, providing volunteer mentors to those who are part of the criminal justice system. Again, this project is driven by volunteers, supported by paid Service Coordinators, who mentor probationers allowing them to reintegrate into society, to ensure that they do not fall back into offending behaviour patterns. We provide counselling, anger management and drug and alcohol awareness training to the Military Correction Training Centre (MCTC). Our qualified counselling team support detainees who have recognised that they need help dealing with drug and alcohol issues or with anger issues. Detainees accessing this very successful service often come from difficult backgrounds or have had challenging upbringings, leading to these issues in adult life. Common feedback from the detainees is that they can't believe it took them being detained to receive the support they so desperately needed around the various issues they have struggled with. The success of this service has meant that, this year, we were awarded the new contract to continue to provide the service until 2019, having provided this service for the last 10 years. We provide a Young People\u2019s Drug and Alcohol services e in Medway both in the community and at HM YOI Cookham Wood. This service proactively helps and supports young people in the Medway area, who are experiencing various issues involving drug and alcohol abuse. The Medway team actively work with the local schools, undertaking visits and making presentations to the students, which has proved very successful in increasing student awareness of the dangers of drugs and alcohol misuse and leading to many young people accessing our services.", "name": "Open Road", "url": "http://www.openroad.org.uk", "id": "GB-COH-02806113", "id_and_name": "[\"Open Road\", \"GB-COH-02806113\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "All Ages", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E07000070", "name": "Chelmsford", "geoCodeType": "NMD", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2017-09-06T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2017-08-31T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 0}], "description": "To help purchase a vehicle for the new SOS Bus service in Chelmsford City", "awardDate": "2017-08-04T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Advance people's physical and mental health, wellbeing and safety", "amountAppliedFor": 10000, "amountAwarded": 7500, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Chelmsford SOS Project", "Primary beneficiary": "People with alcohol/drug addictions", "Primary ethnicity": "White British", "Primary issue": "Health, wellbeing and serious illness", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Yellow Car Charitable Fund", "code": "2017/18"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A451006"}
, {"recipientOrganization": [{"name": "Lads Need Dads CIC", "description": "Who we are: Lads Need Dads CIC is a Not-For-Profit Community Interest Company, based in Tendring, North East Essex, set up to prevent potential problems and address existing ones where boys are missing a father figure in their lives. Our Mission: To empower and enable boys aged 11-15 with absent fathers or limited access to a male role model, to be motivated, responsible, capable, resilient and emotionally competent to prevent them from coming at risk of under achieving, offending, exclusion or dropping out of school. What we do: \u2022 Help boys through male-led group mentoring, to cope with problems and issues faced at home and school, and explore the important choices they face in their adolescent development, to prevent escalation of negative behaviour. \u2022 Provide boys with opportunities for adventure, to be tested and challenged, both physically and mentally. \u2022 Provide boys with practical life-skill training, community volunteering and peer mentoring opportunities. \u2022 Raise awareness and understanding of the important role fathers play in the emotional, mental and educational development and well-being of boys. Why we do it: In 2013 the Centre for Social Justice published Fractured Families: Why stability matters, which highlighted an alarming trend of fatherlessness across the UK. It found that a teenager sitting their GCSEs is more likely to own a smartphone than live with their father, (only 57 per cent of 15-year olds are still living with their fathers while 62 per cent own a smartphone), (1). Nationally almost one quarter of families with dependent children are lone-parent families. (2) This figure rises significantly in our poorest neighbourhoods, and can be as high as 75 percent. (3) Blanden (2006) (4), found a father\u2019s low interest in his son\u2019s education, for instance, reduces his boy\u2019s chances of escaping poverty by 25% and at the more extreme end, 76% of all male prisoners in England and Wales had an absent father. Statistically males are the more vulnerable gender when it comes to alcohol and drug misuse, victims of murder, victims of suicide, homelessness. Lads Need Dads was set up to provide a preventative and early-intervention response to an ever-increasing social issue. Our services: \u2018EQUIP\u2019, is a six-month self-development group-work programme held in school including bush-craft and outdoor activities supported by a facilitator and a team of male mentors. Equips\u2019 aim is to help boys cope with problems and issues faced at home and school, and explore the important choices they face in their adolescent development, to prevent escalation of negative behaviour. Engage, a practical life-skill and community volunteering programme follows Equip and takes place in the community for six-months and involves boys attending practical life-skill workshops and together with thier mentors, doing voluntary work for lone parents, pensioners and people with a disability within their local community. Jobs include, DIY, painting and decorating, gardening, shed building, etc. Inspire, a peer mentoring programme incorporating inspirational speakers and visits to inspiring places, completes the 18-month programme. We have run the 18-month pilot once through between March 2016 and August 2017 with excellent outcomes. We started another Equip Programme in May this year. This ended this month (Nov) and the boys off this programme are now attending Engage, the second part of the programme. Alongside the programme we provide on-going support for mums and carers via workshops, coffee mornings and a face-book support group. We raise awareness within the community by giving talks and presentations to community groups, attending public events etc. We run an open-ended check-in group for graduates of the programme one evening a month to keep the arm of support in place, should they need it. We run a fishing club in the summer which is open to any boy on the programme, graduate or new boy who fits our criteria. We are just about to start a guitar club for boys who want to learn to play the guitar but who can't afford lessons. All our services are provided free of charge. We have a growing team of 14 male volunteer male mentors, between the ages of 29 and 70, from a wide range of backgrounds and from the local community. Our Director board is made up of four professionals from education, social care, statutory services and the voluntary sector. We are just entering into our next round of recruitment so anticipate our volunteer numbers increasing.

Specifically, the MAZE Approach examines these 3 key areas of difficulty for additional needs: \u2022 Sensory Processing Difficulties that 95% of ASD children experience and that can explain many unusual or challenging behaviours. \u2022 Communication difficulties that the children experience, which are often not detected even if they present with functional, fluent speech. \u2022 Social Understanding and an exploration of how an impaired ability to make social sense of situations leads to social difficulties, with a focus on the value of Social Stories. We offer training in the Maze Approach to parents, schools and other professionals.

This may be a learning difficulty, physical disability, autism, ADHD, cerebral palsy or any other additional or special need. We have worked with parents of children with a wide range of difficulties. Many parents do not have sufficient knowledge about their child's condition and are not provided with this information on diagnosis. They are often socially isolated because of their child's difficulties, which commonly include challenging behaviour and they also struggle to access appropriate activities out of school hours. These families experience further difficulties with accessing the appropriate education and support for their child, which can result in school exclusions or tribunals. Additionally, the families face difficulties in accessing services such as O/T, speech therapy or short breaks/services through Social Care and also face very restricted leisure opportunities Here\u2019s what our parents have to say about it: \u201cMy life changed.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "15210R", "description": "Saha is a charitable provider of social housing and support services across England. The Association is registered under the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014 (registration no. 15210R) and the Homes and Communities Agency (registration no. LH 2429). Saha provides accommodation for a range of different people, young and old. Our support services help people to develop their personal talents, flourish and live independently. Our principal activities are the development and management of social housing, primarily for single people. This includes Lifehouses for homeless people, Foyers offering support and training and housing with appropriate support services for vulnerable people. Braintree Foyer is managed and owned by the Salvation Army Housing Association. The Foyer provides accommodation, support and training for 35 people aged 18 \u2013 35 who have experienced homelessness. Braintree Foyer was officially opened in November 1994 as the first purpose built foyer in the UK. Since it opened the foyer has provided accommodation, support and training for over 1000 young people from the Braintree District. In recent years the foyer has been increasingly recognised as an exceptional service and was only the second service ever to receive the Foyer Federation Transformational Innovation Award. In 2016 Braintree Foyer was a finalist of the Essex \u2018Who Will Care\u2019 Innovation Award. Over the past 6 years the Foyer has had an 86% success rate of young people making a positive move on from the foyer. The foyer is always fully occupied and has a waiting list. Braintree Foyer regularly receives visits from international organisations who want to learn about the foyer service. At the last service review undertaken by Essex County Council, Braintree Foyer was commended as, \u2018showing how innovative and creative ideas can support young people to reach goals. The service has a \u2018can do\u2019 attitude and approach and is very warm and welcoming to both service users and the wider community. The staff are engaged and committed to the work they do with their young people and encourage individual learning with an aim to develop independent living skills. Management are focused and open to experiment with new innovative ideas that can assist in developing the above. The service shares good practice with other partners and has an open door policy to share the services good practice\u2019. Braintree Foyer residents come to us from very chaotic backgrounds, having suffered abuse, family breakdown or substance misuse and have been sleeping rough or sofa surfing. Our residents also include care leavers, young people with learning difficulties and mental health issues; they are vulnerable young adults with low self-esteem who find it hard to see a positive future. Many take prescription anti-depressants and self-harming is common. However Braintree Foyer is a service which sees the potential in all young people and which focuses on the person rather than the problem. We challenge young people to be the best that they possibly can by nurturing and promoting young people\u2019s talents and aspirations. Braintree Foyer also supports many young people from the local community through its project work including: Braintree Discovery College Braintree Discovery College was launched in April 2015 to provide a broad curriculum of free courses with the aim of reigniting a love of learning in people who have experienced disadvantage in their lives. Braintree Discovery College removes the barriers to learning and empowers young people take control of their own personal development. Braintree Discovery College offers courses which are completely on the learners own terms and as a result it has been very successful in engaging hard to reach young people. Courses are delivered by volunteers from the local community and further afield. We have high calibre volunteer tutors at the Discovery College including academics, CEO's, authors, campaigners and people who will inspire our young people such as the Paralympian Anne Wafula Strike and the former world champion natural bodybuilder Alun Davies. Since the launch in 2015 over 400 young people have enrolled as students of Braintree Discovery College and more than 1200 sessions have been delivered. Braintree Foyer Community Gym Braintree Foyer Community Gym was opened in 2010 to offer a fully equipped free gym for young people who live at the foyer and people from our local community. Since then more than 300 people have used the gym and completed gym inductions and personal training plans with our gym instructors. At any one time there are 70+ regular active users of the gym. In addition to personal training the Gym offers fitness boot camps, circuit training and the 'Ladies that Lift' Programme which encourages young women to use weight training as part of their excercise. The people from the local community who use our gym are people who would be unable to afford gym memberships at commercial gyms. The Foyer is committed to improving the health and wellbeing of young people. Braintree Sound Academy Braintree Sound Academy was established in 2012 to offer free music workshops and live gigs for young people from Braintree District. The project offers workshops 3 evenings per week and intensive week long courses during the school holidays. Workshops include guitar lessons, drum lessons, singing, sound recording, sound engineering, song writing and DJ and MC workshops At the end of each course is a live gig and since 2012 more than 10,000 people have seen young people from Braintree Sound Academy perform at music festivals, Bocking Arts Theatre and even the Royal Opera House.", "name": "Salvation Army Housing Association", "url": "https://saha.org.uk/", "id": "GB-CHC-15210R", "id_and_name": "[\"Salvation Army Housing Association\", \"GB-CHC-15210R\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Young Adults (19 \u2013 25)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E07000067", "name": "Braintree", "geoCodeType": "NMD", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-02-14T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2017-03-31T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 11}], "description": "To help run a range of educational courses providing disadvantaged young people with an opportunity to rebuild their lives.", "awardDate": "2016-11-07T00:00:00+00:00", "amountAppliedFor": 9213, "amountAwarded": 7500, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Braintree Discovery College", "Primary beneficiary": "Children and Young People", "Primary ethnicity": "British", "Primary issue": "Education and Training", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Wilkinson Family Fund", "code": "2016/17"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A395244"}

The current project involves setting up peer support for older people in Falkirk around issues with food. This project would allow us to expand the service to incorporate more issues, using food as an incentive, a mechanism for forging relationships, a learning tool and confidence builder. We would run a drop in self-help sessions in the West of Falkirk Council Area for people over 50 on low incomes. This part of the demographic makes up 24% of all people claiming unemployment benefits in Falkirk. West of Falkirk is recognised as a cold spot for support services and recent bus routes cancellations made it even harder for people to access the support they need. The self-help sessions will be facilitated by a paid worker and will address issues faced by the participants. When necessary, an outside representative may be brought in, to provide relevant information- for example welfare advice or Mental Health 1st Aid training. This project offers us a chance to work in partnership with other local organisations, such as Falkirk District Association for Mental Health and local Citizens Advice Bureau. The sessions will be initially led by the worker, but the participants will be encouraged to take an equally active role, eventually taking over the running of the sessions once the funded period ends. This way the project should become sustainable. Food will be available at each session to encourage participation and to spread the message about the importance of food, both as a source of nutrition and as a way of connecting with other people. Some of the food will need to be prepared by the participants, as a way of increasing confidence and skills around food and as a way of augmenting social connections between them.", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2017-02-01", "dateModified": "2018-07-05T17:47:00+01:00", "endDate": "2017-08-01"}], "awardDate": "2016-12-02", "amountAppliedFor": 5000, "amountAwarded": 5000, "dataSource": "https://scvo.org/running-your-organisation/funding/community-capacity-resilience-fund/projects/data.json", "filename": "a002400000oKT82AAG.json", "id": "360G-SCVO-a0gb000000QAf2XAAT", "recipientWardNameGeoCode": "S13002971", "title": "Life Boost Cafe - improve your life one cup at a time", "recipientLocation": "S13002971 Govan Ward S12000046 Scotland Glasgow City", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:56:27+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000oKT82AAG.json", "file_type": "json", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "SCVO Community Capacity & Resilience Fund grants", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://scvo.org", "prefix": "360G-SCVO", "logo": "http://www.scvo.org.uk/wp-content/themes/scvo/schemes/default/logo.png", "name": "Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations"}, "issued": "2017-08-18", "funders": [["Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations", "GB-SC-SC003558"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-02-05T14:14:56+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "SCVO Community Capacity & Resilience Fund grants", "accessURL": "https://scvo.org/transparency-open-data", "downloadURL": "https://scvo.org/running-your-organisation/funding/community-capacity-resilience-fund/projects/data.json"}], "identifier": "a002400000oKT82AAG"}, "dateModified": "2018-07-05T17:47:00+01:00", "recipientRegionName": "Scotland", "recipientDistrictName": "Glasgow City", "fundingOrganization": [{"addressRegion": "City of Edinburgh", "charityNumber": "SC003558", "addressLocality": "Edinburgh", "location": [{"latitude": 55.959611, "longitude": -3.190946}], "description": "The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations is the membership organisation for Scotland's charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises.", "streetAddress": "Mansfield Traquair, 15 Mansfield Place", "addressCountry": "Scotland", "department": "Policy", "postalCode": "EH3 6BB", "name": "Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations", "url": "http://scvo.org", "id_and_name": "[\"Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations\", \"GB-SC-SC003558\"]", "id": "GB-SC-SC003558"}], "currency": "GBP", "recipientWardName": "Govan Ward", "fromOpenCall": "Yes", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Community Capacity & Resilience Fund - Call 2", "code": "scvo-ccrf-call-2", "url": "https://scvo.org/running-your-organisation/funding/community-capacity-resilience-fund", "description": "Funding to help local third sector groups and organisations across Scotland tackle poverty and mitigate against UK government welfare changes."}]}

Our Helpline service team offer emotional support and practical help and we source, supply and design items that help children, for example, to learn to feed independently, become toilet trained, to sit, to stand, to walk, to play, to swim, to access education and to keep children safe from harm. The Helpline team is experienced at providing sensitive emotional support and parents frequently 'open up' over the phone about issues that they would be uncomfortable discussing face-to-face. As one parent said of Fledglings, \"We love that there is somewhere we can find solutions to our problems rather than confused faces! You make us feel nearly normal!\" Fledglings primary purpose in trading is to meet the need of the child and family at the best possible price. We focus on meeting individual need as far as it is possible. Our voluntary income and volunteer labour is what makes this possible, as these, in effect, subsidise the cost of the item. Our objectives are to: \u2022 Increase the independence, physical and mental well-being of children living with disabilities and ill-health conditions \u2022 Support children with disabilities to achieve their educational and developmental potential \u2022 Help children with disabilities and their families/carers to experience greater inclusion in all aspects of everyday life such as education, leisure, recreation and healthcare. \u2022 Inform, facilitate and empower families/carers to support their children and each other. \u2022 Help health/social care professional to better support the child patients and families/carers. \u2022 Enable low income families to access our services and products. We co-ordinate a recycling service so that families can donate or sell at low cost items in good condition that might otherwise go to landfill. Our helpline team also identify additional funding sources for low income families. What makes us unique? Businesses supplying products suitable for disabled children and adults are often only supplying one type of item and are often driven by commercial factors which do not take account of individual need. Disability charities supplying products suitable for disabled children generally do so largely as a means of raising income to support other services. Fledglings gives families the opportunity to purchase most of what they need from one source, saving time and money. \u201cSo great to be able to get so many things we need from just one place\". We also keep stocks of many small inexpensive items that can make all the difference to children but are generally only available in packs. By dividing packs we give parents the chance, with minimum financial outlay, to try an individual item to test its effectiveness. Many families come back time-after-time to purchase items from us as their children grow. One of our social worker users tells us: \u201cThe thing that makes your service stand out from any other is that you understand the needs of our families and that you are willing to go the extra mile to source items and remedy individual needs which no other organisation can do!\u201d From a home-based organisation helping local children and families we have now grown into a national charity helping over 26,000 families a year in every region of the UK (up from 23,000 last year). This growth continues. Families find us through google searches, via word of mouth and through referrals from a wide range of health, education and social care professionals including paediatricians, occupational therapists, speech therapists, GP\u2019s, practice nurses, portage workers, social workers, disability teams, children\u2019s centres, school SEN officers, patient groups and disability charities. Due to our origins and location we are pleased to support a larger number of people in Essex than in other parts of the UK. Currently approximately 1306 families, carers and professionals in Essex are supported by Fledglings (increasing from 952 last year) and accounting for 4.98% of all families. As a proportion of the overall running costs (projected at \u00a3411164 in 2017-2018) the cost of supporting families in Essex is approximately \u00a320,475. A recent example of how we have helped a family in Essex is given below; X contacted us in August 2016 to see if we could offer help and advice for her son Y referred from Grove Cottage. Her son has an undiagnosed genetic abnormality, global developmental delay, hyper mobility and is non-verbal. X\u2019s main concern is her son\u2019s severe head banging and his sensory issues. Y has no sense of danger and a very high pain threshold and will bruise and hurt himself so badly that he has to wear a helmet 24/7.Y doesn\u2019t sleep well and recently put his head through a wall when he got out of bed . Y will also rock obsessively, especially at meal times when he is in his high chair. This makes feeding him hard. and pulling at his mother\u2019s hair. Fledglings provided detailed information and advice on safe options for sleeping, a safe and secure high chair that he cannot rock, a safe car seat, secure walking reins, products to help with teeth brushing, a large special needs buggy, sensory toys and solutions, and therapies that are available. We also recommended funding programmes to help towards the cost of the products, therapies and hospital visits. We made a follow up call to X in May 2017 to ask how she was getting on. Things have improved for X. More teams became involved with her family and funding has been secured for the padded room which has, in X\u2019s words, been \u2018life changing\u2019. Y is much happier, he is sleeping through the night, he is less tired, doesn\u2019t bang his head as much and is now much more affectionate \u2013 \u2018a different little boy\u2019. The high chair has helped Y to feed better and the changes in the family situation have been a \u2018miracle\u2019. Y is a different boy who will be attending a special school soon.", "name": "Fledglings Family Services", "url": "http://www.fledglings.org.uk", "id": "GB-COH-04592971", "id_and_name": "[\"Fledglings Family Services\", \"GB-COH-04592971\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Children (5 \u2013 12)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-03-22T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2018-03-31T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 11}], "description": "To help with the running costs of the helpline service provided by a national charity based in Essex supporting families with disabled children", "awardDate": "2017-10-19T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Advance people's physical and mental health, wellbeing and safety", "amountAppliedFor": 10000, "amountAwarded": 10000, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Contribution to the costs of running our core helpline service for children and families in Essex", "Primary beneficiary": "Children and Young People", "Primary ethnicity": "White British", "Primary issue": "Disability and Access issues", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Multiple Funding", "code": "2017/18"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A449254"}

Selected molecules would then be used in a chemical genetics screen against yeast CCT and ATP-site mutants in various of its subunits. Recent work in the Willison laboratory has led to an X-ray crystal structure for yeast CCT which is of sufficiently high resolution to guide the design of mutants. This will allow a level of understanding of this complex molecular machine which has not been achieved by any other approach.

We do this through the following current initiatives: - Rainbow Services provides infrastructure support to local voluntary and community groups, holding regular meetings and publishing a weekly e-bulletin sharing information on subjects relevant to the sector, giving advice and guidance, delivering workshops on topics such as GDPR, and facilitating a voluntary sector hub with affordable room hire and office space. In 16/17 we sent 50 e-briefings out to over 200 organisations; - Rainbow Services also provides direct services to the local community via our Community Builder project, which is currently supporting local older residents. across Harlow who are socially isolated. This project uses an Asset Based Community Development approach to work with older people to develop sustainable social groups, supported by volunteers, and co-ordinate safety and health information sessions combined with social opportunities. In 16/17 over 900 older people were supported ; -Our Business Engagement project is working to facilitate a more structured approach to Corporate Social Responsibility and to create a better pipeline for business involvement and volunteering opportunities with the wider Voluntary Sector and local community, in partnership with Harlow Chamber of Commerce. Started in August 2017, the project has already engaged with 17 VCSE and 5 business organisations and is in the process of matching 6 volunteer opportunities; - Our Workshop project is a contracted arrangement (with Sodexo) to provide a workplace environment for offenders who have received a community service order through the courts in an environment that is, whilst punitive, also rehabilitative and constructive. This project is the only community and voluntary sector run programme which Sodexo offers in Essex and is creating real opportunities for offenders to give back to their community by building and refurbishing items for local groups and organisations, whilst developing transferable skills which could lead to more positive activities on completion of their order. In 16/17 we enabled the completion of 10,515 unpaid work hours and feedback includes \"I have learnt skills I didn't think were possible\"; - we also promote volunteering both internally and externally, and provide diverse volunteering opportunities within Rainbow Services, including intergenerational, reception, workshop, health programmes, and within communications. These opportunities have been used as springboards to paid employment for many of our volunteers, and for others who require supportive environments we have been able to facilitate learning and development through volunteering. In 16/17 2,984 volunteer hours were completed via Rainbow Services; - we pilot and test new ideas with partners. In previous years this has included a Health Navigation Project, which led to the subsequent development of Care Navigation in West Essex. Currently we are working with groups of VCSE organisations, local and district authority representatives, education providers, and community members to find solutions to youth mental health and youth inactivity in Harlow. In addition to this, in November and December 2017 we worked with Passmores Academy in a test programme they were running to tackle disengagement in education. They released 8 young people in Year 8 who were regularly being sent to the STEP (Students Towards Excellent Progress) team office into community activities, supported by the Alternative Provision Officer (Jo Busson). They tried several different activities, including intergenerational volunteering with Rainbow Services. It was found that the most successful elements of the programme were the intergenerational volunteering with Rainbow, where 2 young boys have continued to volunteer and 1 is considering it, and visits from ex-offenders to discuss their experiences. The young people were also better behaved and focused when doing practical activities which kept them busy. This has led to the development of this Workshop programme, which Passmores is supporting and which has been presented to the Safer Harlow Partnership, members of which have also approved the project and offered support.", "name": "Rainbow Services", "url": "http://www.rainbowservices.org.uk", "id": "GB-COH-03826440", "id_and_name": "[\"Rainbow Services\", \"GB-COH-03826440\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "All Ages", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01021843", "name": "Harlow 004E", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-03-02T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2019-03-31T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 23}], "description": "To fund a business engagement project in partnership with the Harlow Chamber of Commerce to broker support to the Harlow voluntary and community sector", "awardDate": "2017-02-21T00:00:00+00:00", "amountAppliedFor": 63000, "amountAwarded": 35000, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "CSR Harlow", "Primary beneficiary": "People with low skill levels", "Primary ethnicity": "All Ethnicities", "Primary issue": "Stronger communities/Community support and development", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Thriving Third Sector Fund", "code": "Full Apps 2016/17"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A432539"}
, {"recipientOrganization": [{"name": "Maze Cares", "description": "Maze Cares provides a welcoming and friendly environment for parent and carers of children with special needs to meet for social interaction, friendship, support, and advice. Through the MAZE Course, which runs for 12 weeks, taking up to 30 parents per course, we help parents better understand and meet the needs of their children. In addition, we offer other support services including monthly coffee mornings, events, speakers, activities, and workshops. Additionally, Maze Cares collaborates with other organisations, voluntary and community sector partners, acting as a signpost to other relevant support, advice and advocacy services. The MAZE Course is a unique approach which aims to develop parent\u2019s knowledge and skills to positively parent their children with disabilities/additional need, such as learning difficulty, autism, ADHD and many other additional needs (SEN/AEN). This work aims to improve family relationships, build social networks of parents and reduce social isolation. The MAZE also aims to empower parents to work towards improving educational outcomes, leisure, and community access opportunities and improving life chances for their children with additional needs. Our funding proposal is for the 12 months from September 2017 to September 2018. Our service users are the parents and carers of children with additional needs. This may be a learning difficulty, physical disability, autism, ADHD, cerebral palsy or any other additional or special need. We have worked with parents of children with a wide range of difficulties. Many parents do not have sufficient knowledge about their child's condition and are not provided with this information on diagnosis. They are often socially isolated because of their child's difficulties, which commonly include challenging behaviour and they also struggle to access appropriate activities out of school hours. These families experience further difficulties with accessing the appropriate education and support for their child, which can result in school exclusions or tribunals. Additionally, the families face difficulties in accessing services such as O/T, speech therapy or short breaks/services through Social Care and also face very restricted leisure opportunities. When parents better understand the additional needs their child has, they are better equipped to raise them. This increased understanding leads to happier parents, happier children and happier siblings, who enjoy a calmer more stable home life, and as a result experience better physical and mental well-being. This is consistently reflected in the feedback we gather at the end of each course. We also hear from parents that after the course they feel empowered by the information and knowledge they have gained. Here\u2019s what our parents have to say about it: \u201cMy life changed. I was lost and I didn\u2019t know what to do. After Maze I have the tools that I need to help myself and my child. My child is happier. Less arguments in my household. Siblings are happy and not fighting.\u201d \u201cMy son has noticed positive changes to his and my relationship as a result of alterations to our lifestyle\u2026I\u2019ve learned so many positive strategies from Sue and other guests and attendees to use at home, and feel very supported.\u201d \u201c[I have] a better understanding of how my daughter thinks, giving me methods to deal with challenging situations\u2026we\u2019re a lot happier.\u201d \u201cIt helped me understand my daughter more\u2026 I see people I can relate with and felt I am not alone. This session is making me strong\u2026.best course I have ever done for my daughter and myself.\u201d \u201cI feel better able to communicate with my child confidently.\u201d We have a hundreds of feedback forms filled with comments like this and 99.6% of parents highly recommend the MAZE. Benefits generated by the Maze Approach include: * Improved family relationships. * Calmer households and families. * Improved understanding and use of positive strategies * Reduced social isolation as our attendees establish a peer support network. * Improved educational provision as parents & carers are more able to advocate for their child, and work with education professionals to ensure their needs are met. * More positive engagement between professionals (including healthcare) and parents. * Improved educational outcomes \u2013 better attendance and reduction in exclusions. * Reduced reliance on mental health services for both parents and children \u2013 we have consistent feedback from parents that they feel stronger, more resilient and better supported * Access to ongoing support for an unlimited amount of time and access to this ensures constant progress and stability for our families. To create a sustainable funding model, we would like to trial a year of requesting parental contributions, and analyse: * how many parents are able to make the contribution. * what impact this model has on the number of places requested. * what impact this model has on the % of sessions attended by parents. In order to run this trial we first need: * To create efficient and sustainable administrative systems to cope with the volume of referrals we are handling (pediatricians, EWMHS, Barnardos and other local family support workers refer to us). To date we have supported 3000 families). * To create systems to measure the social impact and outcomes for families, not just over the 12-week duration of the course but in the months following. * To create systems that enable us to manage data responsibly. And, as we are unsure of how much income will be generated, we need to have the basic venue, refreshment and materials costs covered for the two core Colchester programs that we offer. Any revenue generated from the parental contribution would be used to fund a third Colchester program to help reduce our waiting lists.", "id_and_name": "[\"Maze Cares\", \"360G-EssexCF-ACC687915\"]", "url": "http://www.themazegroup.co.uk/", "id": "360G-EssexCF-ACC687915"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Adults (26 \u2013 65)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01021995", "name": "Tendring 008C", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-04-05T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2017-07-31T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 10}], "description": "To help run informative courses for parents of children with additional needs in Harwich", "awardDate": "2016-12-08T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Promote reduction of isolation and disadvantage and access to local services", "amountAppliedFor": 7069, "amountAwarded": 7069, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Maze Cares Harwich", "Primary beneficiary": "Families/Parents/Lone parents", "Primary ethnicity": "White British", "Primary issue": "Health, wellbeing and serious illness", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Comic Relief Local Communities", "code": "1st Round 2016/17"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A426809"}

This is a diagnosis which attracts stigma and has traditionally led to a degree of exclusion from many statutory and voluntary mental health services.

Most individuals also find it very hard to form healthy attachments and this can lead to vey complex and damaging relationships. The Haven Project services are specifically designed- with the clients who have the diagnosis- to maximise recovery, reduce distress and encourage social contribution.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"name": "Your Living Room CIC", "description": "Your Living Room CIC was set up in March 2015 and is currently the only person-centred decluttering service In Essex for people with a hoarding disorder or chronic disorganisation. One in twenty people in the UK are affected by a condition which leads to social isolation, depression, mental ill health and inadequate living conditions. Since 2013 hoarding has been recognised as a mental health disorder in its own right and covered by the Care Act. Harlow, Colchester and Basildon generate over 50% of our referrals which follows the pattern of Index of Multiple Depravation 2010. Our 'pilot' project evidenced that at its most extreme, this problem can be a matter of life and death. We have helped over 95% of clients reclaim their homes with 5% going into care or with family, by using the multi-agency approach as set down by the EST Guidance protocol, following the solution focused approach. Our organisation has seen a 500% increase in referrals in the last 12 months, as demand is now so urgent. Training our staff to a specialist level allows us to address the very complex situations, support clients mental health, well-being and extend our aftercare support plan with an aim to reduce the likelihood of relapse. Over 85% of clients are trapped in isolation and despair without the courage or knowledge of how to take the next step as their impaired health reduces the client\u2019s ability to deal with their escalating situation as Hoarding Disorder creates severe anxiety, increased depression and total isolation, making them a prisoner of their home and their mind. Re-designing our website in June 2016 has seen a 650% increase in traffic and has increased self referral due to its user friendly layout and information. Your Living Room's non-directive solution focused approach asks our clients as part of their assessment, what is their \u2018vision\u2019 of a good life? We then work with them at a manageable pace to achieve this goal. 95% of our clients experience mental health problems, therefore we felt it was vital to invite a mental health professional to sit on our board of directors. James Mcquiggan the CEO of Mid and North Essex Mind joined us in March 2017 as a non-executive director. James bring's a wealth of expertise to our new partnership and beneficial for the future development of our services surrounding the mental health welfare of our clients. There is evidence that people that are diagnosed with a serious hoarding disorder and have been though an enforced decluttering process are at a higher risk and over 68% become suicidal. Our person-centred approach reduces the risk significantly and gains the trust of our client and working together to maintain a consistent non-threatening relationship with an agreed mutual goal. Our service is specifically aimed at any person in need, those on lower income and who are in desperate e.g. pending an eviction order. We provide support with applications for funds for clients that are not eligible via statutory services, approx. 70% to enable their decluttering process. Mel Hammond, Operations Director from CAB Tending, Welfare Benefit specialist joined us in September 2016 as a NED and brings specialist knowledge with regards to support around financial capability for our clients. Our wrap-around bespoke \u2018aftercare plan\u2019 has been created as a preventative measure to support the client and reduces the risk of re-occurrence beyond the decluttering process: Our clients assessed needs are the basis of their continued pathway out of their suffering and to aid their recovery and improve their health and mental well-being, beyond the remit of statutory services by providing a specialist service to compliment the statutory services provision already in situ. . Following the decluttering process, our non-prescriptive \u2018support plan\u2019 offers a selection of options but is not exhaustive of: Holistic therapies to reduce anxiety, person-centred counselling to increase emotional resilience and assistive technology aids that will reduce social isolation and help reintegrate our client and their community back into society and make a lasting difference to their lives. John Mills our third NED, is a Training and Compliance Director for a national organisation. He also audits via the care quality commission standards within private nursing and residential homes. He delivers specialist healthcare training across England. John will ensure we maintain our support within the required boundaries involving the additional therapies and person-centred counselling we are able to offer. Your Living Room's recruitment process is directed to people that are compassionate, provide semi-therapeutic support whilst showing respect and dignity to our clients to ensure that Your Living Room maintains a standard of excellence. The role is rewarding to those that are equipped with the emotional intelligence to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically. We provide a focused training programme enabling our practitioners to be competent in providing our clients support, someone to listen and as mediation in relation to family issues or neighbour disputes. Our service provides a safer accessible home environment, thus allowing: social care the ability to implement their \u2018care package\u2019 , expedite client discharge from hospital, or provide a safe environment to complete necessary maintenance to the property to meet safety regulations. We look to be a catalyst for change by identifying the clients many \u2018triggers points\u2019 and offer a variety of bespoke methodologies and with added support services from Mind addressing our clients needs, help them achieve their goal and enable their independence.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "1055109", "companyNumber": "03177916", "description": "Beacon House provides primary healthcare and wellbeing services to people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness in Colchester and Essex. Our aim is to relieve sickness and poverty for homeless people. Over the 20 years of operation, the primary care services have been added to and adapted to respond to the changing social, economic and political changes that affect homeless people. The majority of our service users have a complex range of support needs relating to their poor mental and physical health, substance misuse issues, poor emotional management and low self-esteem and motivation. They have little or very limited incomes and are supported by dysfunctional family and social networks. These circumstances and life chances can lead to offending behaviours and a cycle of times on the street and times in prison. Their offence history becomes another barrier as they try to rebuild their lives. All of this is compounded by a lack of a safe and stable base or even an address which is necessary to claim benefits, access health services or open a bank account. A case study from \"Reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners\". Summary of the Social Exclusion Unit report gives a typical example of the homeless and prison cycle: Annette lost her accommodation as a result of entering prison. No one had talked to her when she arrived or during the following months about how she could keep her house or what she could do to ensure that she had somewhere to live on release. Annette\u2019s rent arrears continued to grow while she was in prison and she was evicted. Her early release under curfew was rejected because of the absence of an approved address. On release, her local authority refused to re-house her because of her previous rent arrears. At our day centre in Colchester we are open for at least four hours each day and we do all that we can to address the range of needs of our service users. We have a person-centred approach, and form relationships of trust with people to help them access the external support they need and to identify the internal resilience that they have. We recognise the differing aspects of homelessness including rough sleeping, sofa surfing, hostel places and temporary accommodation, and that these different statuses require different support. We also support people who have been recently housed to encourage the development of social, financial and basic living skills so that they do not lose their tenancies, or return to offending behaviours. We provide services to people at all stages of homelessness. We provide a nurse-led clinic with primary treatment and triage support. The clinic offers a Needle Exchange, Sexual Health testing, protection and advice. We provide screening services and can be the first point of detection for serious health conditions. 70% of people seeing the nurse do not need any further referral to a GP. We provide a barber, a podiatrist, showering facilities and a laundry service to ensure that people are clean and not refused services due to their appearance. We provide new and recycled clothes, bedding and toiletries. We provide a postal address, a place to recharge phones, and a suite of computers for internet access. There are welcoming places where people can get refreshments and hot food. When basic needs are met, we work with individuals to change their circumstances and behaviours, to reduce offending behaviours and dependence on substances, to improve their mental health and their coping mechanisms, to improve their meaningful use of time and their social networks, to improve their personal hygiene and their life skills. We work with each individual on personalized set of goals, which are based on their timescale and are meaningful to them. We host several different voluntary and statutory support services in our building to ensure that there is continuity of care and they are in a safe and supported space. Our occupational therapy support includes art therapy, photography projects, gardening and ecotherapy, and shared cooking and eating. We identify some of the behaviours that are trauma related, and work with people to develop alternative strategies to manage their pain, rejection and hopelessness. A considerable part of our support function is to work with housing providers, employers and other support agencies. We are often the only organisation who has had consistent and on-going interaction with some of the most marginalized people in Colchester. We are therefore able to provide references for landlords and employers. We often prepare character references for people attending magistrates court, and often represent individuals at joint agency case conferences. Our unique position of supporting people before they are ready to engage with services makes us invaluable at the point where they want to change, but only have a bad record for their past behaviours. We act as arbitrators for landlords, and have established relationships with landlords where no deposit is required if the tenant is referred by Beacon House. Many of the costs of re-offending by ex-prisoners are not quantifiable, but can be devastating and longterm, and are frequently felt by the most vulnerable in society. Most obviously, there is the impact on victims, many of whom will be repeat victims, and on their families; also on communities, predominantly the most disadvantaged. In turn, where re-offenders are caught and imprisoned, a heavy toll is taken on their families and on their own lives. It is difficult to assess at which point an individual will decide to change their own mindset and behaviours that will enable them to face their daily challenges without resorting to substances or offending behaviour. We have created an environment at Beacon House where people feel accepted, supported and able to accept support and help to move forward towards acceptance and stability in the wider community.", "name": "Beacon House Ministries", "url": "http://www.beaconhouseministries.org.uk", "id": "GB-COH-03177916", "id_and_name": "[\"Beacon House Ministries\", \"GB-COH-03177916\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Adults (26 \u2013 65)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01021648", "name": "Colchester 007C", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-01-24T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2017-10-27T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 11}], "description": "To support homeless people with mental ill-health to access healthcare in Colchester.", "awardDate": "2016-11-04T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Advance people's physical and mental health, wellbeing and safety", "amountAppliedFor": 8519, "amountAwarded": 8519, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Going the extra mile", "Primary beneficiary": "Homeless people", "Primary ethnicity": "All Ethnicities", "Primary issue": "Health, wellbeing and serious illness", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Healthwatch Essex Fund", "code": "Small 2016/17"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A421434"}

The Association is registered under the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014 (registration no. 15210R) and the Homes and Communities Agency (registration no. LH 2429). Saha provides accommodation for a range of different people, young and old. Our support services help people to develop their personal talents, flourish and live independently. Our principal activities are the development and management of social housing, primarily for single people. This includes Lifehouses for homeless people, Foyers offering support and training and housing with appropriate support services for vulnerable people. Braintree Foyer is managed and owned by the Salvation Army Housing Association. The Foyer provides accommodation, support and training for 35 people aged 18 \u2013 35 who have experienced homelessness. Braintree Foyer was officially opened in November 1994 as the first purpose built foyer in the UK. Since it opened the foyer has provided accommodation, support and training for over 1000 young people from the Braintree District. In recent years the foyer has been increasingly recognised as an exceptional service and was only the second service ever to receive the Foyer Federation Transformational Innovation Award. In 2016 Braintree Foyer was a finalist of the Essex \u2018Who Will Care\u2019 Innovation Award. Over the past 6 years the Foyer has had an 86% success rate of young people making a positive move on from the foyer. The foyer is always fully occupied and has a waiting list. Braintree Foyer regularly receives visits from international organisations who want to learn about the foyer service. At the last service review undertaken by Essex County Council, Braintree Foyer was commended as, \u2018showing how innovative and creative ideas can support young people to reach goals. The service has a \u2018can do\u2019 attitude and approach and is very warm and welcoming to both service users and the wider community. The staff are engaged and committed to the work they do with their young people and encourage individual learning with an aim to develop independent living skills. Management are focused and open to experiment with new innovative ideas that can assist in developing the above. The service shares good practice with other partners and has an open door policy to share the services good practice\u2019. Braintree Foyer residents come to us from very chaotic backgrounds, having suffered abuse, family breakdown or substance misuse and have been sleeping rough or sofa surfing. Our residents also include care leavers, young people with learning difficulties and mental health issues; they are vulnerable young adults with low self-esteem who find it hard to see a positive future. Many take prescription anti-depressants and self-harming is common. However Braintree Foyer is a service which sees the potential in all young people and which focuses on the person rather than the problem. We challenge young people to be the best that they possibly can by nurturing and promoting young people\u2019s talents and aspirations. Braintree Foyer also supports many young people from the local community through its project work including: Braintree Discovery College Braintree Discovery College was launched in April 2015 to provide a broad curriculum of free courses with the aim of reigniting a love of learning in people who have experienced disadvantage in their lives. Braintree Discovery College removes the barriers to learning and empowers young people take control of their own personal development. Braintree Discovery College offers courses which are completely on the learners own terms and as a result it has been very successful in engaging hard to reach young people. Courses are delivered by volunteers from the local community and further afield. We have high calibre volunteer tutors at the Discovery College including academics, CEO's, authors, campaigners and people who will inspire our young people such as the Paralympian Anne Wafula Strike and the former world champion natural bodybuilder Alun Davies. Since the launch in 2015 over 400 young people have enrolled as students of Braintree Discovery College and more than 1200 sessions have been delivered. Braintree Foyer Community Gym Braintree Foyer Community Gym was opened in 2010 to offer a fully equipped free gym for young people who live at the foyer and people from our local community. Since then more than 300 people have used the gym and completed gym inductions and personal training plans with our gym instructors. At any one time there are 70+ regular active users of the gym. In addition to personal training the Gym offers fitness boot camps, circuit training and the 'Ladies that Lift' Programme which encourages young women to use weight training as part of their excercise. The people from the local community who use our gym are people who would be unable to afford gym memberships at commercial gyms. The Foyer is committed to improving the health and wellbeing of young people. Braintree Sound Academy Braintree Sound Academy was established in 2012 to offer free music workshops and live gigs for young people from Braintree District. The project offers workshops 3 evenings per week and intensive week long courses during the school holidays. Workshops include guitar lessons, drum lessons, singing, sound recording, sound engineering, song writing and DJ and MC workshops At the end of each course is a live gig and since 2012 more than 10,000 people have seen young people from Braintree Sound Academy perform at music festivals, Bocking Arts Theatre and even the Royal Opera House.", "name": "Salvation Army Housing Association", "url": "https://saha.org.uk/", "id": "GB-CHC-15210R", "id_and_name": "[\"Salvation Army Housing Association\", \"GB-CHC-15210R\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Young Adults (19 \u2013 25)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01021365", "name": "Braintree 009D", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-04-17T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2018-04-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2019-03-31T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 11}], "description": "To retain the Support Manager /Discovery College Co-ordinator for one year in order to continue support to young people from chaotic backgrounds", "awardDate": "2018-01-18T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Advance people's physical and mental health, wellbeing and safety", "amountAppliedFor": 33986, "amountAwarded": 33986, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Braintree Foyer", "Primary beneficiary": "Homeless people", "Primary ethnicity": "White British", "Primary issue": "Homelessness", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Braintree District and Greenfields Community Fund", "code": "Full Apps 2017/18"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A464153"}

Through these sessions we help them to improve their communication with peers, families and agencies so they are more resilient. By learning skills that will help them to problem solve their issues in the future more positively. By identifying their qualities, we progress onto a range of youth led group activities, this helps them to hone in on their often, hidden talents.

We have worked with many local organisations, done considerable outreach and consultations with local older people. Both our current programme and future plans directly reflect older users' priorities. Over the past year, the Clockhouse Project has run joint activities with 10 different partner organisations (including Oxfordshire Adult Learning, Agnes Smith Advice Centre, Oxford Brookes University, housing associations, African School etc). Our strong \"grass-roots\" base combined with an excellent range of partnerships means we can act quickly and imaginatively to respond to new opportunities which tie in with our users\u2019 priorities. Recent examples include community mosaic project with Oxford WEA which proved very popular with local over-50's and Time to Talk, a project which created short films with individual residents that formed part of a reminiscence exhibition at the Museum of Oxford.

MNS disorders account for >25% of all years lived with disability globally, more than cardiac disease or cancer [2]. The treatment gap is vast, only 10% of people with MNS disorders in low-income countries access evidence-based treatments, compared to 33% in high-income countries [3]. Reasons for this include low awareness ofthe burden of MNS disorders and limited evidence to support development, adaptation and implementation of effective and feasible treatments. While pockets of mental health research excellence exist in Africa, MNS research capacity is generally limited, particularly in mental health intervention, service and system research. Mental health research excellence is currently undermined by restricted opportunities for training and mentorship, unclear career pathways, lack of integration in general medical settings, limited multi-disciplinary collaboration and the lack of a critical mass of MNS researchers and leaders. The overall goals of the African Mental Health Research Initiative (AMARI) areto build an African-led network of MNS researchers in Ethiopia, Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe, equipped to lead high quality mental health research programmes that meet the needs of their countries, and to establish a sustainable career pipeline for these researchers with the emphasis on integrating MNS research into existing programmes such as HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health. The objectives are to: 1. Select and train MNS research fellows from a range of disciplines at masters (n=25), PhD (n=20) and post-doctoral (n=6) levels in research excellence; 2. Build leadership skills of 26 fellows through adaptation of KCL Career Development Series on Leadership, Management and Mentoring; 3. Design and test an advocacy and systems change strategy for each country, aimed at building sustainable career pathways in MNS academia; 4. Develop a web-based support platform for training, supervision and networking. In year 1 we will undertake preparatory work to inform course development, thedesign of the advocacy and systems change strategy and gather baseline data for each country, for evaluation purposes, conducting qualitative and quantitative interviews with local policymakers and service users to identify needs and priorities through a theory of change map. We willtrain local supervisors, run pre-application workshops for potential applicants and assess existing training materials. . In years 2-5, fellows will begin higher degrees and courses as relevant. Trainingwill be mostly in Africa and using a) joint supervision by local and external supervisors with multidisciplinary expertise, b) taught modules in advanced MNS research methods, writing, and engagement with policy makers, and c) undertaking high priority MNS research. The underlying ethos of AMARI will be to ensure LMIC partner capacity is strengthened progressively towards self-sufficiency to ensure sustainability longer term. AMARI will be led by University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences (UZ-CHS). All consortium institutions will provide course facilitators and supervisors, with the Centrefor Global Mental Health (CGMH), University of Cape Town (UCT) and University College London (UCL) providing external supervision, research experts and materials for adaptation.

The vibrant programme will culminate in the Artful Symposium. This unusual artist-led event at the Royal Society of Medicine will present invited mental health audiences with art and performances by people with personal experience of mental illness. The aim is that this unique context of a shared mediating experience of art will form the basis for reflection and fresh dialogue around mental health in this historically fraught and polarised field.

This has led me to propose a model of adaptive behavioural control in which perceptual input can initiate behaviour via two parallel routes. An associative  system is proposed subject to affective  feedback, with positively valued outcomes leading to strengthening of stimulus-response connecti ons and negative outcomes leading to weakening of these linkages. In contrast a Rule  based system represents associations supramodally and exerts indirect control of behaviour via the associative system.

Our Values We care for the homeless and vulnerable; respecting their need for safety and dignity. We promote a sense of security, self worth and acceptance of the diversity of the individuals we serve. We encourage the growth and development of our staff and service users through partnerships and training opportunities with others. We are committed to equality of opportunity for all. Our Aims We encourage responsible living standards from our service users. To provide an adequate number of good standard accommodation for the single homeless. Encouraging service users to rejoin society society as useful members. Supporting improvement in the health and well being of service users without discrimination or judgement. Giving practical help in achieving independent living and employment. Raising awareness of homelessness in Chelmsford and Essex. To become a catalyst for change and partnership recognising the resources of others. In order to meet our mission and aims we provide a 7 bedroom direct access night shelter (soon to be a 9 bedroom night shelter when we move to our new premises on New London Road) giving accommodation to people who would otherwise be street homeless. Each resident is allocated a support worker to assist the resident to identify what lead them to become homeless and identify ways to prevent this in the future. Basic counselling is provided but if this grant application is awarded it would allow for more specialist trauma therapy to be provided to improve the chances of the resident succeeding in moving on in a positive way. Five move on properties are provided to allow a stepped process of change towards more independent accommodation outside of CHESS. In total we can house up to 30 individuals at any given time.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"companyNumber": "03038603", "description": "What we do: We provide a user-led vocational rehabilitation service that includes therapeutic work-experience and vocational skills-development for adults recovering from illness and/or suffering social disadvantage. This is conducted in a safe and supportive environment. Our work is conducted on an on-going basis. Clients are referred to us when they are in need of our services. All individuals are different, as are their needs and their rehabilitation requirements. We facilitate recovery at a pace that is suited to each individual. Aims and Objectives: The organisation was set up in 1995, as a company limited by guarantee with charitable aims, to serve the interests of those individuals recovering from long term mental health problems. We now also accept people with other disabilities such as mild learning difficulties or head injuries, but the majority of beneficiaries remain those recovering from mental ill health. Our objectives are; \u2022 To work towards improving the social wellbeing and quality of life of our service users; \u2022 To provide continuous learning and development opportunities for our beneficiaries; \u2022 To provide furniture restoration services to the general public, to partly fund the first two objectives but primarily to facilitate the re-integration of our service users in to main stream society. We aim to make a lasting difference to the lives of our service users who, because of the nature of their disabilities, experience barriers to full participation within the community. . Training, Skills, Qualifications and Work Experience: Training and Qualifications; The Co-operative has been a City & Guilds approved centre since 1997. We offer service users training, in all aspects of furniture restoration, where they have opportunities to work towards gaining City & Guilds Qualifications in the following subjects at level 1 and 2: \u2022 French Polishing \u2022 Cabinet Making \u2022 Upholstery Skills; Clients learn practical skills and underpinning knowledge, as required by the qualification being pursued; they receive support and guidance on a one to one basis from two qualified trainers. We also offer additional training in Business Administration and Book keeping although this is unaccredited. Work Experience; An important aspect of clients\u2019 involvement is for them to gain genuine work experience to enhance their future employment prospects. All service users are engaged in activity that offers a high level of participation and engagement. An aspect of this is clients\u2019 involvement in the delivery of furniture services to the public. This gives them a further opportunity to apply the skills learnt during courses in a work environment and to regain a wider consideration of the responsibilities of being an employee. Working with other organisations; We are regularly contacted by, and work in partnership with, referring agencies including NHS rehabilitation teams, social services and charitable organisations. We work in partnership with support workers from, mainly, community mental health teams and, on occasions, social services and other referring agencies. Individuals receive support and clinical care from these organisations. We offer a service which is not provided by these agencies, but which complements the work they do and seeks to reduce barriers to service users\u2019 recovery and their engagement with society. Alleviating Stigma and Discrimination \u2013 and social isolation; Houses of Parliament POST NOTE Number 422, October 2012, addressing Stigma and Discrimination, reports- \u201cStigma and discrimination are barriers to accessing social environments such as the workplace. They can affect individuals when seeking employment. For example, a survey conducted by the anti-stigma and discrimination campaign, Time to Change, found that of 2,082 people surveyed, 56% would not employ an individual who had depression even if they were the most suitable candidate\u201d. Our furniture services, together with evening classes that are made available to the general public, provide a wider benefit to the local community. We help to raise awareness among our customers - through explaining the social aspect of our work, about the issue of disability and how this presents barriers to participation in the community. This together with clients\u2019 contact with the public helps to alleviate stigma and discrimination and reduce social isolation. Evidence of Need We have provided a valuable and unique service that has operated in Chelmsford for almost 23 years, during which time there has been a waiting list. Millrace has developed a reputation for good practice within the mental health sector in Mid-Essex and helped over 140 people. The service is unique to the area in terms of the environment and skills taught. A strong link exists between social deprivation and poor mental health. There are wards situated in North East Chelmsford where there are higher than average levels of deprivation. \u201cOne in six people in the Essex will suffer a mental health problem in the course of this year. Although the numbers are predicted to remain stable, more people whose mental health problems currently go untreated are predicted to come forward as a result of better diagnosis and increased awareness due to Public health campaigns intended to reduce stigma.\u201d (Source: Hope for Better Mental Health, Public Office Essex County Council 2015).", "name": "Mill Race Furniture Restoration Co-operative Ltd", "url": "http://www.millracefurniture.co.uk", "id": "GB-COH-03038603", "id_and_name": "[\"Mill Race Furniture Restoration Co-operative Ltd\", \"GB-COH-03038603\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Adults (26 \u2013 65)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01033140", "name": "Chelmsford 010F", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-03-02T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2018-04-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2019-03-31T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 11}], "description": "To help provide training in furniture restoration to aid people with mental health issues to get back into work", "awardDate": "2018-02-22T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Advance people's physical and mental health, wellbeing and safety", "amountAppliedFor": 7724, "amountAwarded": 7724, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Millrace Furniture Restoration Co-operative - continuation of existing work", "Primary beneficiary": "People with mental health issues", "Primary ethnicity": "White British", "Primary issue": "Health, wellbeing and serious illness", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Coombewood Amenity Fund", "code": "2017/18"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A467990"}

In this partnership, the emphasis is on identifying and working towards a short term goal to improve wellbeing. The empathy that comes from being a peer supporter allows an environment of trust, so the commitment to staying well is sustained long after the partnership ends.

Our work comprises a long-established volunteer home visiting service, offering emotional and practical help to families experiencing difficulties, alongside a range of family groups, well-being programmes, courses and events. What makes our charity special, is that all our trained volunteers have lived experience as parents/carers themselves. We believe in the power of community mobilisation, and so invest in local areas to support local families. Our Vision is: \u2018For every child and young person in Essex to grow up in a family that is strong, resilient and able to access the support they need; when and where they need it\u2019 HSE recognises that bringing up children can be hard work. All parents and carers will, from time to time, encounter problems which make the task harder. The key to success is for parents and carers to be strong and resilient, so they can meet challenges head on, and navigate their way through or around them successfully. Through mobilising hundreds of volunteers, we support families to help themselves, developing parenting skills and improving connections in their community. Our volunteers support families struggling with: \u2022 Mental Health issues (including peri/post-natal depression, etc.) \u2022 Financial hardship \u2022 Physical health issues \u2022 Single parenthood \u2022 Low self-esteem and confidence \u2022 Domestic abuse \u2022 Isolation \u2022 Routines and boundaries \u2022 Bereavement and other significant life events The main activities of HSE are as follows: \u2022 Home-Visiting service, led by volunteers \u2022 Family Groups \u2022 School Readiness programme (e.g. Big Hopes-Big Futures) \u2022 Peri/post-natal support groups \u2022 Targeted mental health and wellbeing programmes \u2022 Counselling \u2022 Volunteer training and recruitment \u2022 Information, Advice, Guidance (IAG) and signposting \u2022 Food Bank Voucher distribution \u2022 Family activity days Our main funders are The Big Lottery Fund, BBC Children in Need, Virgin/Banardo\u2019s PB-19yrs Contract, Essex Community Foundation, Clinical Commissioning Groups and local trusts. A new 5-Year Strategic Plan will be launched in March 2018 which will see HSE developing its funding streams to be more diverse; allowing the organisation to grow and build on excellent practice. Since April 2017, HSE has supported 368 families and 755 children, with over 200 trained volunteers offering 1,834 home visits, totalling 3,006 hours\u2019 time across Essex. 95% of all frontline delivery continues to be entirely volunteer led. It is currently estimated that over the course of one year, the value of HSE volunteer time will be over \u00a372,000 (ONS figures https://goo.gl/Uwz2cz). HSE measures impact across 14 individual areas of need (e.g. isolation, mental health, family conflict, etc.) with over 80% of families showing significant positive change. \u201cMy volunteer made a huge difference. Someone who\u2019s not going to judge and always took the time to stop and listen\u201d. We know that our model allows us to engage with those who would otherwise be considered \u2018hard to reach\u2019. Families frequently tell us the impact of a volunteer, giving their time freely, can be far more meaningful than a paid statutory professional. Isolation and mental health issues remain the top two concerns for most of the families we support, and this often means their ability to access mainstream services is limited. This provides HSE a unique opportunity to implement our proposed PICoD Project (Preventative IAG Co-Design) project; a three-year co-produced, family-led process that will develop a new model of information, advice and guidance (IAG). This will be aimed at those predominantly in the peri/post-natal period; a key period for those at risk of poor mental health and well-being. As an existing provider of peri/postnatal services in Harlow, and with a strong history of peer/ volunteer led practice, HSE are ideally positioned to lead on the project; building on our expertise and ability to engage families; ensuring that their voice is not only heard, but responded to in practical, real terms. HSE are confident that the project is deliverable as commitment has been tested with partners (e.g. Virgin/Banardo\u2019s and University of Essex (UofE)) who say objectives are both realistic and achievable. By drawing on our existing network of partners, and engagement with families, HSE are keen to shape the future of family led practice. We believe this is achievable by harnessing the voices and opinions of service users as a tool; to shape and influence the way in which future information, advice and service delivery is commissioned. At HSE, our approach to project design, development and delivery is thorough and systematic. At concept stage, HSE appoints a Project Lead and a Project Delivery Team to draft delivery plans (in a standard format) and undertake initial research. This involves liaising with stakeholders (staff, service users, potential funders and partners, etc.); testing project feasibility; identifying resource needs; establishing project milestones/dependencies/budgets; and undertaking SWOT analysis. This forms the foundation for funding applications/development, as part of the new 2018 Funding Strategy. Upon funding success, our Development Team hands over to the Project Delivery Team, who refine proposals and manage the initiative on an ongoing basis, reporting back to Management, Trustees and Funders in a structured way. This gives assurance to stakeholders involved, that the way HSE delivers projects, is transparent and well managed.", "name": "Home-Start Essex", "url": "http://www.home-startessex.org.uk", "id": "GB-COH-10348139", "id_and_name": "[\"Home-Start Essex\", \"GB-COH-10348139\"]"}], "Primary issue": "Mental health", "Primary age group": "Adults (26 \u2013 65)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E07000070", "name": "Chelmsford", "geoCodeType": "NMD", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-04-11T00:00:00+00:00", "description": "Towards a \u2018Moving on up Together\u2019 project for parents struggling with low self-esteem and mental health issues in Chelmsford", "awardDate": "2017-03-15T00:00:00+00:00", "amountAppliedFor": 15661, "amountAwarded": 15661, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Moving on up Fund", "Primary beneficiary": "Adults", "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Chrysalis Fund", "code": "2016/17"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A440001"}

Since April 2017, HSE has supported 368 families and 755 children, with over 200 trained volunteers offering 1,834 home visits, totalling 3,006 hours\u2019 time across Essex. 95% of all frontline delivery continues to be entirely volunteer led. It is currently estimated that over the course of one year, the value of HSE volunteer time will be over \u00a372,000 (ONS figures https://goo.gl/Uwz2cz). HSE measures impact across 14 individual areas of need (e.g. isolation, mental health, family conflict, etc.) with over 80% of families showing significant positive change. \u201cMy volunteer made a huge difference. Someone who\u2019s not going to judge and always took the time to stop and listen\u201d. We know that our model allows us to engage with those who would otherwise be considered \u2018hard to reach\u2019. Families frequently tell us the impact of a volunteer, giving their time freely, can be far more meaningful than a paid statutory professional. Isolation and mental health issues remain the top two concerns for most of the families we support, and this often means their ability to access mainstream services is limited. This provides HSE a unique opportunity to implement our proposed PICoD Project (Preventative IAG Co-Design) project; a three-year co-produced, family-led process that will develop a new model of information, advice and guidance (IAG). This will be aimed at those predominantly in the peri/post-natal period; a key period for those at risk of poor mental health and well-being. As an existing provider of peri/postnatal services in Harlow, and with a strong history of peer/ volunteer led practice, HSE are ideally positioned to lead on the project; building on our expertise and ability to engage families; ensuring that their voice is not only heard, but responded to in practical, real terms. HSE are confident that the project is deliverable as commitment has been tested with partners (e.g. Virgin/Banardo\u2019s and University of Essex (UofE)) who say objectives are both realistic and achievable. By drawing on our existing network of partners, and engagement with families, HSE are keen to shape the future of family led practice. We believe this is achievable by harnessing the voices and opinions of service users as a tool; to shape and influence the way in which future information, advice and service delivery is commissioned. At HSE, our approach to project design, development and delivery is thorough and systematic. At concept stage, HSE appoints a Project Lead and a Project Delivery Team to draft delivery plans (in a standard format) and undertake initial research. This involves liaising with stakeholders (staff, service users, potential funders and partners, etc.); testing project feasibility; identifying resource needs; establishing project milestones/dependencies/budgets; and undertaking SWOT analysis. This forms the foundation for funding applications/development, as part of the new 2018 Funding Strategy. Upon funding success, our Development Team hands over to the Project Delivery Team, who refine proposals and manage the initiative on an ongoing basis, reporting back to Management, Trustees and Funders in a structured way. This gives assurance to stakeholders involved, that the way HSE delivers projects, is transparent and well managed.", "name": "Home-Start Essex", "url": "http://www.home-startessex.org.uk", "id": "GB-COH-10348139", "id_and_name": "[\"Home-Start Essex\", \"GB-COH-10348139\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Early Years (0 \u2013 4)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01021820", "name": "Harlow 006B", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-02-14T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2017-10-31T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 11}], "description": "To continue a weekly family group to support and advise vulnerable and disadvantaged families", "awardDate": "2016-11-25T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Promote reduction of isolation and disadvantage and access to local services", "amountAppliedFor": 7524, "amountAwarded": 6000, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Continue existing work with the Family Group", "Primary beneficiary": "Families/Parents/Lone parents", "Primary ethnicity": "White British", "Primary issue": "Supporting family life", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Ian and Angela Marks Charitable Fund", "code": "2016/17"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A422983"}

Feasibility of delivering psychiatric consultation services via tele-psychiatry to patients with mental health problemsidentified in primary care. Vast number of patients in India access health care at the primary level however availability ofmental heath care is poor in these settings. This is largely due to lack of trained mental health manpower. Further thehealth personnel at primary level are poorly trained to identify and treat mental health issues. It will not be possible tobridge this mental health treatment gap in the near future hence this innovative use of tele-psychiatry viavideoconferencing is being considered. Though telepsychiatry has been used in some settings it remains to be seen if it can be integrated into the primary health system, which if found to be possible would have significant impact on mentalhealth care delivery in India. We aim to demonstrate that it is feasible to integrate such services into routine primary healthcare.2. Acceptability of tele-psychiatry services to various stakeholders including the delivery agents, patients, and their familymembers. One of the challenges would be engaging the end user and the peripheral health team in delivering care in asafe and acceptable manner. Besides feasibility and acceptability there are other concerns in delivering such a servicesuch as issues of privacy, confidentiality, record-keeping, ethical and legal implications as well as duty of care andhandling of emergencies. The study will delve into these issues through in-depth interviews with all stakeholders.3. Preliminary impact of psychiatric consultation services delivered via tele-psychiatry on various outcomes in patients with mental health problems identified in primary care. We will recruit patients identified with Depression, Alcohol use disorders and Severe Mental Illness; before-after assessments of symptom burden and disability levels will be done to determine the impact of the tele-psychiatric consultations.

Audrey Amiss, an artist who worked as a civil service typist for most of her life, was diagnosed in her mid-twenties with paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. She entered her first psychiatric hospital at this point and, up till her death in 2013, just short of her 80th birthday, was a \"revolving door\" psychiatric patient/user, referring to herself in later years as a \"mental health survivor\". My chief goals are to use the research to ultimately write a screenplay for a feature film based on Audrey\u2019s life and, in addition, I wish to use the research to write a book about Audrey and her artwork. Both the book and the screenplay and subsequent film will give valuable insight into the life of an artist and living with various mental health diagnoses.\n", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "https://wellcome.ac.uk", "prefix": "360G-wellcome", "logo": "https://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/wellcome-logo-black.png", "name": "Wellcome Trust"}, "issued": "2018-03-21", "funders": [["The Wellcome Trust", "GB-CHC-210183"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-03-27T07:02:32+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "accessURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/grants-awarded", "downloadURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000xQ047AAC"}, "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2017-10-31T00:00:00+00:00"}], "awardDate": "2017-05-18T00:00:00+00:00", "amountAwarded": 25000, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "The Wellcome Trust", "id_and_name": "[\"The Wellcome Trust\", \"GB-CHC-210183\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-210183"}], "Region": "Unknown", "Approval Committee": "Internal Decision Panel for C&S", "currency": "GBP", "title": "AUDREY AMISS COLLECTION", "Financial Year": "2016/17", "filename": "a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "Lead Applicant": "Ms carol morley", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Research Resources Bursaries"}], "id": "360G-Wellcome-208341_Z_17_Z"}

This is a \"game changer\" in terms of the research that can be conducted. Data can be collected on larger, more varied, international populations. We can study people in environments they don\u2019t find intimidating, and multiple times per day, without data collection becoming impractical.\n\nWe need better tools to create those studies. PsychoPy is a cross-platform open-source software package for creating experiments using OpenGL and Python. It is hugely popular mostly because relatively non-technical users can generate an enormous range of studies with high precision.

The aims of Citizens Advice are to provide advice people need for problems they face and to improve policies and practices affecting people's lives. There are two main offices, in Addlestone and Sunbury Library, offering drop-ins five and three days per week. Unpaid volunteers give their time to help their fellow citizens by providing free, independent, confidential and impartial advice on rights and responsibilities. The CAB also operates an outreach service at the Abraham Cowley Unit, for users of mental health services. There are also outreach services in Stanwell and Englefield Green. Runnymede and Spelthorne CAB provide a Home Visiting service to people who are housebound, as well as the Runnymede Rentstart (RR) service. RR is based in Addlestone and provides assistance with finding privately rented accommodation, providing a deposit in the form of a guarantee bond, rent in advance and tenancy support.

Hoarding disorder (HD), previously considered a subtype of OCD, has been proposed as a unique diagnostic entity in DSM-5. Current models of HD emphasize problems of decision-making, attachment to possessions, and poor insight, whereas previous neuroimaging studies have suggested abnormalities in fro ntal brain regions. The project will create a unique, powerful piece of theatre with a dramaturgical structure informed by neurological research, How The Light Gets In tells the story of an architect, living in Japan, who returns home to clear out her mother's house following her death. The design and the musical score will evoke the architect's attempts to escape her genetic destiny through a deliberately minimalist life in Japan, contrasted with the claustrophobia of compulsive hoarding. Lau ra's script examines the neurological aetiologies of hoarding (identified by researchers David F. Tolin, et al.) and illustrates these through narrative, and the Japanese architectural aesthetics, shibumi and wabi-sabi - which contemplate the beauty of imperfect, tarnished, and worn out things. Laura is working with three core creative collaborators all at the top of their game: puppeteer and stage designer Shona Reppe, singer/actor Camille O'Sullivan, and leading psychotherapist Stelios Kioss es, who successfully uses shibumi and zen concepts in hoarding therapy and will work as script consultant.

At the age of thirty-seven, after suffering an illness that left her blind in h er left eye, Gill began to create art passionately and created thousands of mediumistic work over 40 years. She claimed to be guided by a spirit called 'Myrninrest' and often signed her drawings with this name. Her drawings often contain the figure of a young woman, possibly a self portrait. Her work is in all sizes from postcard size to over 30ft. The exhibition will contain loans from Newham Borough Council (who hold rarely seen work by Gill in their collection) and from the Henry Boxer Galler y and will be curated by Roger Cardinal, a leading critic who originally coined the term 'outsider art.'

As sporadic and monogenetic Parkinsonism share important neuropathological and clinical features, notably the susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra to cell damage, insight into the function of disease causing gene mutations is expected to promote our understanding of key regulatory pathways involved in PD neurodegeneration. Mutations in the Fbxo7 gene have recently been linked to a complex, young-onset Parkinsonian syndrome. Little is known about the physiological role of the Fbxo7 protein or how mutations results in PD-associated neurodegeneration. The aim of my research project is to elucidate the signal transduction pathway of Fbxo7 utilizing standard and human-derived, patient-specific cell lines, but also by generating a new mouse model with human disease-associated knock in and conditional knock-out mutations of the Fbxo7 gene.

My research project aims to translate these new state of the art quantitative proteomics methods in a clinical context and to compare results obtained in model human cell systems in the laboratory with changes observed in patient biopsy samples. Using model human cell lines, in which the expression of known tumour suppressor proteins and/or oncogenes can be modulated using small molecule inducers, the Lamond laboratory has identified human proteins which were previously unknown to be associated with mechanisms relevant to cell transformation. This includes the protein products of the human Formin 2 (FMN2) and MRFAP1 genes. I will characterise the expression of both these proteins in human malignancies, assess their suitability as biomarkers and explore how new, advanced proteomics methods can be used to identify other proteins whose expression is altered in human cancer tissue.", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "https://wellcome.ac.uk", "prefix": "360G-wellcome", "logo": "https://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/wellcome-logo-black.png", "name": "Wellcome Trust"}, "issued": "2018-03-21", "funders": [["The Wellcome Trust", "GB-CHC-210183"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-03-27T07:02:32+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "accessURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/grants-awarded", "downloadURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000xQ047AAC"}, "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2010-09-06T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2014-08-05T00:00:00+00:00"}], "awardDate": "2010-08-31T00:00:00+00:00", "Sponsor(s)": "Prof Doreen Cantrell", "amountAwarded": 220113, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "The Wellcome Trust", "id_and_name": "[\"The Wellcome Trust\", \"GB-CHC-210183\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-210183"}], "Region": "Scotland", "Approval Committee": "Neurosciences And Mental Health", "currency": "GBP", "title": "Wellcome Trust Clinical PhD Programme at the University of Dundee: 'The translation of quantitative proteomics applied to human disease'.", "Financial Year": "2009/10", "Applicant Surname": "Kirkwood", "Lead Applicant": "Dr Kathryn Kirkwood", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "PhD Training Fellowship for Clinicians"}], "id": "360G-Wellcome-093990_Z_10_Z"}

Friern mental hospital in northeast London - once the notorious lunatic asylum, Colney Hatch - closed in 1993. I was a patient there in the late 1980s. Using Friern's records alongside my own and other people's memories of it, I look in detail at the hospital's closure and its impact on those - patients, staff, and managers - involved in the transition from institutional to community care. I  explore the relational life of the hospital and the changes in care principles and practices that accompanied deinstitutionalisation. Mental health services in the UK today are governed by a recovery model that emphasises patient choice and independence, and proscribes open-ended 'dependent' care relationships. I examine the treatment and care principles displaced by this new model, the attitudinal changes that underpin it, and its reception from mental health professionals and service users. My  key goal is to provide new insights into the recent history of mental health care in the UK, and to stimulate and inform discussion of this important public issue.", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "https://wellcome.ac.uk", "prefix": "360G-wellcome", "logo": "https://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/wellcome-logo-black.png", "name": "Wellcome Trust"}, "issued": "2018-03-21", "funders": [["The Wellcome Trust", "GB-CHC-210183"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-03-27T07:02:32+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "accessURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/grants-awarded", "downloadURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000xQ047AAC"}, "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2011-09-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2012-08-31T00:00:00+00:00"}], "awardDate": "2011-03-09T00:00:00+00:00", "amountAwarded": 50326, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "The Wellcome Trust", "id_and_name": "[\"The Wellcome Trust\", \"GB-CHC-210183\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-210183"}], "Region": "Greater London", "Approval Committee": "Medical History and Humanities Funding Committee", "currency": "GBP", "title": "The Death of the Asylum in Late Twentieth Century Britain.", "Financial Year": "2010/11", "filename": "a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "Lead Applicant": "Prof Barbara Taylor", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Personal Support: Inactive Scheme"}], "id": "360G-Wellcome-095745_Z_11_Z"}

MNS disorders account for >25% of all years lived with disability globally, more than cardiac disease or cancer [2]. The treatment gap is vast, only 10% of people with MNS disorders in low-income countries access evidence-based treatments, compared to 33% in high-income countries [3]. Reasons for this include low awareness ofthe burden of MNS disorders and limited evidence to support development, adaptation and implementation of effective and feasible treatments. While pockets of mental health research excellence exist in Africa, MNS research capacity is generally limited, particularly in mental health intervention, service and system research. Mental health research excellence is currently undermined by restricted opportunities for training and mentorship, unclear career pathways, lack of integration in general medical settings, limited multi-disciplinary collaboration and the lack of a critical mass of MNS researchers and leaders. The overall goals of the African Mental Health Research Initiative (AMARI) areto build an African-led network of MNS researchers in Ethiopia, Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe, equipped to lead high quality mental health research programmes that meet the needs of their countries, and to establish a sustainable career pipeline for these researchers with the emphasis on integrating MNS research into existing programmes such as HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health. The objectives are to: 1. Select and train MNS research fellows from a range of disciplines at masters (n=25), PhD (n=20) and post-doctoral (n=6) levels in research excellence; 2. Build leadership skills of 26 fellows through adaptation of KCL Career Development Series on Leadership, Management and Mentoring; 3. Design and test an advocacy and systems change strategy for each country, aimed at building sustainable career pathways in MNS academia; 4. Develop a web-based support platform for training, supervision and networking. In year 1 we will undertake preparatory work to inform course development, thedesign of the advocacy and systems change strategy and gather baseline data for each country, for evaluation purposes, conducting qualitative and quantitative interviews with local policymakers and service users to identify needs and priorities through a theory of change map. We willtrain local supervisors, run pre-application workshops for potential applicants and assess existing training materials. . In years 2-5, fellows will begin higher degrees and courses as relevant. Trainingwill be mostly in Africa and using a) joint supervision by local and external supervisors with multidisciplinary expertise, b) taught modules in advanced MNS research methods, writing, and engagement with policy makers, and c) undertaking high priority MNS research. The underlying ethos of AMARI will be to ensure LMIC partner capacity is strengthened progressively towards self-sufficiency to ensure sustainability longer term. AMARI will be led by University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences (UZ-CHS). All consortium institutions will provide course facilitators and supervisors, with the Centrefor Global Mental Health (CGMH), University of Cape Town (UCT) and University College London (UCL) providing external supervision, research experts and materials for adaptation.

The discovery that PD follows Mendelian inheritance patterns in some families has led to the identification of PD associated genes. As sporadic and monogenetic Parkinsonism share important neuropathological and clinical features, notably the susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra to cell damage, insight into the function of disease causing gene mutations is expected to promote our understanding of key regulatory pathways involved in PD neurodegeneration. Mutations in the Fbxo7 gene have recently been linked to a complex, young-onset Parkinsonian syndrome. Little is known about the physiological role of the Fbxo7 protein or how mutations results in PD-associated neurodegeneration. The aim of my research project is to elucidate the signal transduction pathway of Fbxo7 utilizing standard and human-derived, patient-specific cell lines, but also by generating a new mouse model with human disease-associated knock in and conditional knock-out mutations of the Fbxo7 gene. It is hoped that the findings of the proposed project contribute to a better understanding of PD pathogenesis, the development of new treatment options and possibly the availability of a valid PD mouse model.", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "https://wellcome.ac.uk", "prefix": "360G-wellcome", "logo": "https://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/wellcome-logo-black.png", "name": "Wellcome Trust"}, "issued": "2018-03-21", "funders": [["The Wellcome Trust", "GB-CHC-210183"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-03-27T07:02:32+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "accessURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/grants-awarded", "downloadURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000xQ047AAC"}, "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2010-09-06T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2014-04-05T00:00:00+00:00"}], "awardDate": "2010-08-31T00:00:00+00:00", "Sponsor(s)": "Prof Doreen Cantrell", "amountAwarded": 227413, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "The Wellcome Trust", "id_and_name": "[\"The Wellcome Trust\", \"GB-CHC-210183\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-210183"}], "Region": "Scotland", "Approval Committee": "Neurosciences And Mental Health", "currency": "GBP", "title": "Wellcome Trust Clinical PhD Programme at the University of Dundee.", "Financial Year": "2009/10", "Applicant Surname": "Sammler", "Lead Applicant": "Dr Esther Sammler", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "PhD Training Fellowship for Clinicians"}], "id": "360G-Wellcome-093989_Z_10_Z"}

The Bromley Healthy Families project will support parents and their primary school aged children by providing a range of stimulating workshops around healthy eating and healthy lifestyles which in turn will aim to reduce food bank dependency during school holidays (which is prevalent in Congleton), tackle poverty stricken households and enhance wellbeing amongst children and parents. This focused yet holistic approach to family support will make a positive and lasting difference. The funding will enable weekly workshops to take place during the school holidays for a year - including ingredients, professional tutors, recipes, educational materials, training workshops for parents and the purchase of cooking equipment to enable the project to become self-sufficient and parent-led after the 12 month period, leaving a lasting legacy and commitment towards healthy lifestyles.", "recipientLocation": "E05008668 Ellesmere Port Town Ward E06000050 North West Cheshire West and Chester", "recipientDistrictName": "Cheshire West and Chester", "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Cheshire Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Cheshire Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1143711\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1143711"}], "Round": {"Round Name": "2017 2 July"}, "currency": "GBP", "Grant Application": {"ID": "a061600000ma7V2"}, "grantProgramme": [{"title": "CCF - Main Grants Programme"}], "Grant Application No": "A447720"}
