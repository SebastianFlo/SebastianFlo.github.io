The charity was first established in January 2003 under the name of the Holly & Chloe School of Dance and had the objects of giving relief, education and a leisure activity to local children with disabilities by the provision of therapeutic and educational exercises through the medium of dance. These aims were later changed to encompass adult services, and the name of the charity was also changed in August 2011 when Dramatize Charity Trust was established. However, two of the Trustees who established the original charity have remained engaged. The CIC was established in October 2012 in order to operate the Theatrical Day Service from Ashford Pavilion in Ashford Park. Although the primary focus is adults (18+) with disabilities, Dramarize also offers a range of workshops for young people, as it wishes to be all encompassing in its goal of bringing empowerment to its service users by enabling them to develop professionally and personally. Dramatize works with individuals with learning disabilities ranging from mild to profound. A range of activities are provided which will broaden students' knowledge and provide a form of respite for parents/carers. The Dramatize club offers offer a safe, supportive, and secure environment in which individuals enjoy a range of activities including drama, arts, sports and community outings. Dramatize employs 1 full-time and 10 part-time staff members, who are supported by 6 volunteers and a management committee of 4 Trustees.",

It operates with three aims: 1/ to offer PWLD choice in holiday options and day-trips at affordable (/subsidised) prices; 2/ to provide respite for those who care for PWLD; 3/ to give young people training and volunteering opportunities to support this vulnerable group on our outings both for the immediate gain of assisting positively and so they are better equipped to promote community cohesion. In 2009, Yellow Submarine partnered with two day centres and a local authority and four holidays with 19 PWLD (and their carers who gained respite) benefitting. The trips that have taken place so far have been very popular and successful both with the \u2018service users\u2019, their carers and the volunteers who helped. Video feedback can be viewed on our site, with carers saying the holidays have helped increase confidence, create new friendships, and give a welcome break! Yellow Submarine believes people with learning disabilities deserve to live life to the full. We are a small award-winning charity which prides itself on giving some of the most disadvantaged people in Oxfordshire confidence, independence and a sense of self-worth. For children (aged 11-18) living in Oxfordshire we run an extensive programme in the school holidays. For adults (18+) we run residential holidays, work experience & training and a weekly social club.

It operates with three aims: 1/ to offer PWLD choice in holiday options and day-trips at affordable (/subsidised) prices; 2/ to provide respite for those who care for PWLD; 3/ to give young people training and volunteering opportunities to support this vulnerable group on our outings both for the immediate gain of assisting positively and so they are better equipped to promote community cohesion. In 2009, Yellow Submarine partnered with two day centres and a local authority and four holidays with 19 PWLD (and their carers who gained respite) benefitting. The trips that have taken place so far have been very popular and successful both with the \u2018service users\u2019, their carers and the volunteers who helped. Video feedback can be viewed on our site, with carers saying the holidays have helped increase confidence, create new friendships, and give a welcome break! Yellow Submarine believes people with learning disabilities deserve to live life to the full. We are a small award-winning charity which prides itself on giving some of the most disadvantaged people in Oxfordshire confidence, independence and a sense of self-worth. For children (aged 11-18) living in Oxfordshire we run an extensive programme in the school holidays. For adults (18+) we run residential holidays, work experience & training and a weekly social club.

Objectives: 1)To help 50% more people 2) To increase capacity in the volunteer workforce by 50% 3) To double current level of unrestricted income 4) To ensure that no relevant government initiative takes place without IPSEA input IPSEA aims to help parents to support their children and young people with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND) to obtain appropriate education and training that is a legal requirement under the Children and Family Act 2014. We also advise local and national government on legislation, policies and implementation relating to SEN. We provide support and advice to parents/carers of children and young people with SEND. All our advice and support is delivered by our dedicated volunteers, supported by a small staff team. IPSEA is a user-led organisation. Many of our volunteers, staff, members and trustees are parents/carers of children or young people with SEND. We have developed a website with a raft of resources that are downloadable free for parents. This is complemented by a separate advice line which provides legally based information and next step advice on any educational issues that is a result of the child\u2019s or young persons SEND. The tribunal helpline gives next step advice on appeals and disability discrimination claims to the SEND Tribunal, this is also the gateway to our Tribunal Support Service where a referral can be made for more extensive support from a volunteer. Making a SEND tribunal appeal is very complicated. The appeal system involves vast amounts of paperwork, evidence has to be gathered from professional witnesses & there is a complex timetable with multiple deadlines. There is no Legal Aid for representation at hearings. There is limited Legal Aid to assist with preparing a case. Lawyers charge up to \u00a310,000 to prepare & represent these tribunal cases. Meanwhile the Local Authorities against whom these appeals are registered have teams of lawyers to prepare their case and representing them at the tribunal hearing. IPSEA's unique Tribunal Support Service addresses this need - free of charge. IPSEA has highly trained volunteers who act as individual caseworkers for SEND Tribunal appeals. These Tribunal Support volunteers complete our accredited legally-based tribunal training in order to provide individual casework support and advocacy for children throughout their tribunal appeal. Access to this specialised service is only available via our Tribunal Helpline. Volunteers with experience of supporting appeals on behalf of children to the SEND Tribunal cover this specialist helpline, using their accredited legally-based IPSEA training and casework experience to offer next-step tribunal appeal support over the telephone. If a child needs individual casework support, our Tribunal Helpline volunteers refer them to our Tribunal Support service. The criteria for this referral are based on the child's household income, the complexity of the child's appeal and whether the child's family can cope with the appeal process. This referral process allows us to offer the most support to the most disadvantaged children. We carefully match each tribunal appeal to a volunteer with the right experience. Our volunteer represents the child throughout their appeal process; managing the timetable, gathering/compiling evidence, helping with paperwork and attending the hearing to advocate for the child against the Local Authority lawyers. Our volunteers won 86% of their appeals in 2015. IPSEA also provides a wide range of training for parents, School Staff, Parent Forums, support groups and other groups and organisations in order to empower users with information and increase their confidence.We developed unique training on the SEND reforms. We have already trained 2,000 people from other organisations this year. We work in partnership with the National Parent Partnership Network (now IASS), training their staff on the SEND reforms. Where we are involved in tribunals our legal team write briefings and resources in order to disseminate and share the learning. A further innovative aspect of our organisation is our campaigning and policy work and our members have been key is shaping both policy and law.",

                    "description": "Fledglings Family Services design and source practical, affordable, good quality products and solutions to everyday problems experienced by children with physical and learning disabilities and health conditions. Our Helpline service team offer emotional support and practical help and we source, supply and design items that help children, for example, to learn to feed independently, become toilet trained, to sit, to stand, to walk, to play, to swim, to access education and to keep children safe from harm. The Helpline team is experienced at providing sensitive emotional support and parents frequently 'open up' over the phone about issues that they would be uncomfortable discussing face-to-face. As one parent said of Fledglings, \"We love that there is somewhere we can find solutions to our problems rather than confused faces! You make us feel nearly normal!\" Fledglings primary purpose in trading is to meet the need of the child and family at the best possible price. We focus on meeting individual need as far as it is possible. Our voluntary income and volunteer labour is what makes this possible, as these, in effect, subsidise the cost of the item. Our objectives are to: \u2022 Increase the independence, physical and mental well-being of children living with disabilities and ill-health conditions \u2022 Support children with disabilities to achieve their educational and developmental potential \u2022 Help children with disabilities and their families/carers to experience greater inclusion in all aspects of everyday life such as education, leisure, recreation and healthcare. \u2022 Inform, facilitate and empower families/carers to support their children and each other. \u2022 Help health/social care professional to better support the child patients and families/carers. \u2022 Enable low income families to access our services and products. We co-ordinate a recycling service so that families can donate or sell at low cost items in good condition that might otherwise go to landfill. Our helpline team also identify additional funding sources for low income families. What makes us unique? Businesses supplying products suitable for disabled children and adults are often only supplying one type of item and are often driven by commercial factors which do not take account of individual need. Disability charities supplying products suitable for disabled children generally do so largely as a means of raising income to support other services. Fledglings gives families the opportunity to purchase most of what they need from one source, saving time and money. \u201cSo great to be able to get so many things we need from just one place\". We also keep stocks of many small inexpensive items that can make all the difference to children but are generally only available in packs. By dividing packs we give parents the chance, with minimum financial outlay, to try an individual item to test its effectiveness. Many families come back time-after-time to purchase items from us as their children grow. One of our social worker users tells us: \u201cThe thing that makes your service stand out from any other is that you understand the needs of our families and that you are willing to go the extra mile to source items and remedy individual needs which no other organisation can do!\u201d From a home-based organisation helping local children and families we have now grown into a national charity helping over 26,000 families a year in every region of the UK (up from 23,000 last year). This growth continues. Families find us through google searches, via word of mouth and through referrals from a wide range of health, education and social care professionals including paediatricians, occupational therapists, speech therapists, GP\u2019s, practice nurses, portage workers, social workers, disability teams, children\u2019s centres, school SEN officers, patient groups and disability charities. Due to our origins and location we are pleased to support a larger number of people in Essex than in other parts of the UK. Currently approximately 1306 families, carers and professionals in Essex are supported by Fledglings (increasing from 952 last year) and accounting for 4.98% of all families. As a proportion of the overall running costs (projected at \u00a3411164 in 2017-2018) the cost of supporting families in Essex is approximately \u00a320,475. A recent example of how we have helped a family in Essex is given below; X contacted us in August 2016 to see if we could offer help and advice for her son Y referred from Grove Cottage. Her son has an undiagnosed genetic abnormality, global developmental delay, hyper mobility and is non-verbal. X\u2019s main concern is her son\u2019s severe head banging and his sensory issues. Y has no sense of danger and a very high pain threshold and will bruise and hurt himself so badly that he has to wear a helmet 24/7.Y doesn\u2019t sleep well and recently put his head through a wall when he got out of bed . Y will also rock obsessively, especially at meal times when he is in his high chair. This makes feeding him hard. and pulling at his mother\u2019s hair. Fledglings provided detailed information and advice on safe options for sleeping, a safe and secure high chair that he cannot rock, a safe car seat, secure walking reins, products to help with teeth brushing, a large special needs buggy, sensory toys and solutions, and therapies that are available. We also recommended funding programmes to help towards the cost of the products, therapies and hospital visits. We made a follow up call to X in May 2017 to ask how she was getting on. Things have improved for X. More teams became involved with her family and funding has been secured for the padded room which has, in X\u2019s words, been \u2018life changing\u2019. Y is much happier, he is sleeping through the night, he is less tired, doesn\u2019t bang his head as much and is now much more affectionate \u2013 \u2018a different little boy\u2019. The high chair has helped Y to feed better and the changes in the family situation have been a \u2018miracle\u2019. Y is a different boy who will be attending a special school soon.",

We are often described as a community centre without a roof! The farm remains firmly focused on enabling people and communities to grow. In response to the needs of local residents, many of who experience high levels of deprivation and disadvantage, we provide a range of innovative and inspiring educational, environmental and recreational activities that facilitate personal development, promote health and wellbeing, social cohesion and community regeneration. Our work particularly benefits disadvantaged local young people, young families, disabled people, isolated older people and people experiencing mental health problems. Our success at engaging the local community and hard-to-reach people has led to Bristol City Council regarding our project as a major player in the future community development of the area.",

We see this as an incredible opportunity to build a genuinely inclusive council of young people to inspire individual social change, through their own leadership journeys and social change through challenging stereotypes. Whilst the YOC will have a more comprehensive role within Oxford, ROAR is an event which will mobilise the group to carry out direct social action, examine the barriers in place that face young people with disabilities. Ark T also recognise that there are many economic barriers in place for families of disabled children and young people, and the YOC will focus on potential strategic options for dismantling these barriers. Ark T want to provide space, resources, belief, and guidance to this group in order to generate a new wave of diverse creative leaders who influence the future of culture in Oxford.",

We provide an opportunity for deaf families to have a safe environment where both hearing and deaf people are equal. During the mother's group we teach baby sign. In the future we will be restarting BSL sign language courses. The 'drop in' service is a service that the deaf community can access for assistance with correspondance, appointments or to be sign posted to the appropriate service ensuring that there is an appropriately qualified interpreter there. The service is aimed at all age groups and ethnicity. We support both deaf people with hearing children and hearing people with deaf children.",

There is no service in place to provide support for the deaf community in the area. With welfare reform and lack of employment opportunity this is leading to deterioration in many families and individuals mental health. The communication barrier faced by many Deaf in our society is a huge hurdle that needs to be addressed. Rather than valuable members of our society being left at home we need to put things in place to enable them to access and have the same rights as their hearing counterparts. We already have strong links with other advice agencies such as North Lanarkshire Disability Forum and CAB. Through these links we would be able to signpost and provide the much-needed advice to the Deaf community. Our communication support worker will be there to translate from BSL to English. Within the Deaf community there is a very high unemployment rate. This was highlighted in the information gathering in the lead up to the British Sign Language (Scotland) Act 2015 being approved. Many young Deaf and deaf families live in poverty and are unaware of changes to the welfare system due to nothing being sent out in their own language of BSL. There have been many changes in how to access information and apply for jobs. Many companies now choose to put their applications online. Many Deaf people cannot access this as they cannot understand written English and cannot afford to have Internet at home. We aim to provide a service where Deaf people can come and have help in accessing application forms, making phone calls on their behalf and assisting with welfare benefits advice.",

                    "description": "Who we are: Lads Need Dads CIC is a Not-For-Profit Community Interest Company, based in Tendring, North East Essex, set up to prevent potential problems and address existing ones where boys are missing a father figure in their lives. Our Mission: To empower and enable boys aged 11-15 with absent fathers or limited access to a male role model, to be motivated, responsible, capable, resilient and emotionally competent to prevent them from coming at risk of under achieving, offending, exclusion or dropping out of school. What we do: \u2022 Help boys through male-led group mentoring, to cope with problems and issues faced at home and school, and explore the important choices they face in their adolescent development, to prevent escalation of negative behaviour. \u2022 Provide boys with opportunities for adventure, to be tested and challenged, both physically and mentally. \u2022 Provide boys with practical life-skill training, community volunteering and peer mentoring opportunities. \u2022 Raise awareness and understanding of the important role fathers play in the emotional, mental and educational development and well-being of boys. Why we do it: In 2013 the Centre for Social Justice published Fractured Families: Why stability matters, which highlighted an alarming trend of fatherlessness across the UK. It found that a teenager sitting their GCSEs is more likely to own a smartphone than live with their father, (only 57 per cent of 15-year olds are still living with their fathers while 62 per cent own a smartphone), (1). Nationally almost one quarter of families with dependent children are lone-parent families. (2) This figure rises significantly in our poorest neighbourhoods, and can be as high as 75 percent. (3) Blanden (2006) (4), found a father\u2019s low interest in his son\u2019s education, for instance, reduces his boy\u2019s chances of escaping poverty by 25% and at the more extreme end, 76% of all male prisoners in England and Wales had an absent father. Statistically males are the more vulnerable gender when it comes to alcohol and drug misuse, victims of murder, victims of suicide, homelessness. Lads Need Dads was set up to provide a preventative and early-intervention response to an ever-increasing social issue. Our services: \u2018EQUIP\u2019, is a six-month self-development group-work programme held in school including bush-craft and outdoor activities supported by a facilitator and a team of male mentors. Equips\u2019 aim is to help boys cope with problems and issues faced at home and school, and explore the important choices they face in their adolescent development, to prevent escalation of negative behaviour. Engage, a practical life-skill and community volunteering programme follows Equip and takes place in the community for six-months and involves boys attending practical life-skill workshops and together with thier mentors, doing voluntary work for lone parents, pensioners and people with a disability within their local community. Jobs include, DIY, painting and decorating, gardening, shed building, etc. Inspire, a peer mentoring programme incorporating inspirational speakers and visits to inspiring places, completes the 18-month programme. We have run the 18-month pilot once through between March 2016 and August 2017 with excellent outcomes. We started another Equip Programme in May this year. This ended this month (Nov) and the boys off this programme are now attending Engage, the second part of the programme. Alongside the programme we provide on-going support for mums and carers via workshops, coffee mornings and a face-book support group. We raise awareness within the community by giving talks and presentations to community groups, attending public events etc. We run an open-ended check-in group for graduates of the programme one evening a month to keep the arm of support in place, should they need it. We run a fishing club in the summer which is open to any boy on the programme, graduate or new boy who fits our criteria. We are just about to start a guitar club for boys who want to learn to play the guitar but who can't afford lessons. All our services are provided free of charge. We have a growing team of 14 male volunteer male mentors, between the ages of 29 and 70, from a wide range of backgrounds and from the local community. Our Director board is made up of four professionals from education, social care, statutory services and the voluntary sector. We are just entering into our next round of recruitment so anticipate our volunteer numbers increasing.

When the Hall became a registered charity in 1948 its charitable objectives were recorded as being 'use by the public for the benefit of the people of Hockley and the surrounding area to increase recreation and education facilities'. Currently the Hall hosts a number of small community groups . These include a dance school, a slimming club, a majorette group, a yoga school, and a fitness group. The Hall also provides a venue for a group called Ark ll who provide special Sunday sessions for people who would normally be alone at the weekends. These groups are the Hall's regular users but the Hall also provides a popular venue for events such as quiz nights and celebrations such as the Queen's Jubilee. The Hall is also used to host children birthdays and family parties. The Trustees for Hockley Public Hall include representatives of the Parish Council and the church. The trustees are aware of the long record of service of the Public Hall which stretches back to its construction 124 years ago. The Hall has survived bomb damage in World War 2 and is the oldest community venue in Hockley. Over the past few years the Trustees have worked hard to raise funding to help refurbish the Hall's structure and facilities including the replacement of the roof and improving toilet facilities and disabled access. The trustees are aware of the important role the Hall continues to play in providing an affordable venue for small community groups in this difficult economic period, helping to support community cohesion and involvement in Hockley.",

                    "description": "The MAZE is a unique approach, which offers an insight into how children with additional needs experience the world around them in order that parents can better understand their children and why they respond in the way that they do. Specifically, the MAZE Approach examines these 3 key areas of difficulty for additional needs: \u2022 Sensory Processing Difficulties that 95% of ASD children experience and that can explain many unusual or challenging behaviours. \u2022 Communication difficulties that the children experience, which are often not detected even if they present with functional, fluent speech. \u2022 Social Understanding and an exploration of how an impaired ability to make social sense of situations leads to social difficulties, with a focus on the value of Social Stories. We offer training in the Maze Approach to parents, schools and other professionals. In the training for parents (which is what we are asking for partial funding for) we cover: The topics covered are: \u2022Session 1: Introductions \u2022Session 2: Sensory Processing Difficulties \u2022Session 3: Communication Strategies \u2022Session 4: Social Understanding \u2022Session 5: Lifestyle issues (sleep, continence, diet) \u2022Session 6: Behaviour Management - using positive strategies Session 7: Positive Family Relationships \u2022Session 8: Behaviour Management - limit setting and consequences \u2022Session 9: Functional Behaviour Analysis \u2022Session 10: My Childs Development \u2022Session 11: What about me? Building resilience \u2022Session 12: Planning For The Future - moving on Our service users are the parents and carers of children with additional needs. This may be a learning difficulty, physical disability, autism, ADHD, cerebral palsy or any other additional or special need. We have worked with parents of children with a wide range of difficulties. Many parents do not have sufficient knowledge about their child's condition and are not provided with this information on diagnosis. They are often socially isolated because of their child's difficulties, which commonly include challenging behaviour and they also struggle to access appropriate activities out of school hours. These families experience further difficulties with accessing the appropriate education and support for their child, which can result in school exclusions or tribunals. Additionally, the families face difficulties in accessing services such as O/T, speech therapy or short breaks/services through Social Care and also face very restricted leisure opportunities Here\u2019s what our parents have to say about it: \u201cMy life changed. I was lost and I didn\u2019t know what to do. After Maze I have the tools that I need to help myself and my child. My child is happier. Less arguments in my household. Siblings are happy and not fighting.\u201d \u201cMy son has noticed positive changes to his and my relationship as a result of alterations to our lifestyle\u2026I\u2019ve learned so many positive strategies from Sue and other guests and attendees to use at home, and feel very supported.\u201d \u201c[I have] a better understanding of how my daughter thinks, giving me methods to deal with challenging situations\u2026we\u2019re a lot happier.\u201d \u201cIt helped me understand my daughter more\u2026 I see people I can relate with and felt I am not alone. This session is making me strong\u2026.best course I have ever done for my daughter and myself.\u201d \u201cI feel better able to communicate with my child confidently.\u201d We have a hundreds of feedback forms filled with comments like this and 99.6% of parents highly recommend the MAZE."

                    "description": "Maze Cares provides a welcoming and friendly environment for parent and carers of children with special needs to meet for social interaction, friendship, support, and advice. Through the MAZE Course, which runs for 12 weeks, taking up to 30 parents per course, we help parents better understand and meet the needs of their children. In addition, we offer other support services including monthly coffee mornings, events, speakers, activities, and workshops. Additionally, Maze Cares collaborates with other organisations, voluntary and community sector partners, acting as a signpost to other relevant support, advice and advocacy services. The MAZE Course is a unique approach which aims to develop parent\u2019s knowledge and skills to positively parent their children with disabilities/additional need, such as learning difficulty, autism, ADHD and many other additional needs (SEN/AEN). This work aims to improve family relationships, build social networks of parents and reduce social isolation. The MAZE also aims to empower parents to work towards improving educational outcomes, leisure, and community access opportunities and improving life chances for their children with additional needs. Our funding proposal is for the 12 months from September 2017 to September 2018. Our service users are the parents and carers of children with additional needs. This may be a learning difficulty, physical disability, autism, ADHD, cerebral palsy or any other additional or special need. We have worked with parents of children with a wide range of difficulties. Many parents do not have sufficient knowledge about their child's condition and are not provided with this information on diagnosis. They are often socially isolated because of their child's difficulties, which commonly include challenging behaviour and they also struggle to access appropriate activities out of school hours. These families experience further difficulties with accessing the appropriate education and support for their child, which can result in school exclusions or tribunals. Additionally, the families face difficulties in accessing services such as O/T, speech therapy or short breaks/services through Social Care and also face very restricted leisure opportunities. When parents better understand the additional needs their child has, they are better equipped to raise them. This increased understanding leads to happier parents, happier children and happier siblings, who enjoy a calmer more stable home life, and as a result experience better physical and mental well-being. This is consistently reflected in the feedback we gather at the end of each course. We also hear from parents that after the course they feel empowered by the information and knowledge they have gained. Here\u2019s what our parents have to say about it: \u201cMy life changed. I was lost and I didn\u2019t know what to do. After Maze I have the tools that I need to help myself and my child. My child is happier. Less arguments in my household. Siblings are happy and not fighting.\u201d \u201cMy son has noticed positive changes to his and my relationship as a result of alterations to our lifestyle\u2026I\u2019ve learned so many positive strategies from Sue and other guests and attendees to use at home, and feel very supported.\u201d \u201c[I have] a better understanding of how my daughter thinks, giving me methods to deal with challenging situations\u2026we\u2019re a lot happier.\u201d \u201cIt helped me understand my daughter more\u2026 I see people I can relate with and felt I am not alone. This session is making me strong\u2026.best course I have ever done for my daughter and myself.\u201d \u201cI feel better able to communicate with my child confidently.\u201d We have a hundreds of feedback forms filled with comments like this and 99.6% of parents highly recommend the MAZE. Benefits generated by the Maze Approach include: * Improved family relationships. * Calmer households and families. * Improved understanding and use of positive strategies * Reduced social isolation as our attendees establish a peer support network. * Improved educational provision as parents & carers are more able to advocate for their child, and work with education professionals to ensure their needs are met. * More positive engagement between professionals (including healthcare) and parents. * Improved educational outcomes \u2013 better attendance and reduction in exclusions. * Reduced reliance on mental health services for both parents and children \u2013 we have consistent feedback from parents that they feel stronger, more resilient and better supported * Access to ongoing support for an unlimited amount of time and access to this ensures constant progress and stability for our families. To create a sustainable funding model, we would like to trial a year of requesting parental contributions, and analyse: * how many parents are able to make the contribution. * what impact this model has on the number of places requested. * what impact this model has on the % of sessions attended by parents. In order to run this trial we first need: * To create efficient and sustainable administrative systems to cope with the volume of referrals we are handling (pediatricians, EWMHS, Barnardos and other local family support workers refer to us). To date we have supported 3000 families). * To create systems to measure the social impact and outcomes for families, not just over the 12-week duration of the course but in the months following. * To create systems that enable us to manage data responsibly. And, as we are unsure of how much income will be generated, we need to have the basic venue, refreshment and materials costs covered for the two core Colchester programs that we offer. Any revenue generated from the parental contribution would be used to fund a third Colchester program to help reduce our waiting lists."

                    "description": "Who we are: Lads Need Dads CIC is a Not-For-Profit Community Interest Company, based in Tendring, North East Essex, set up to prevent potential problems and address existing ones where boys are missing a father figure in their lives. Our Mission: To empower and enable boys aged 11-15 with absent fathers or limited access to a male role model, to be motivated, responsible, capable, resilient and emotionally competent to prevent them from coming at risk of under achieving, offending, exclusion or dropping out of school. What we do: \u2022 Help boys through male-led group mentoring, to cope with problems and issues faced at home and school, and explore the important choices they face in their adolescent development, to prevent escalation of negative behaviour. \u2022 Provide boys with opportunities for adventure, to be tested and challenged, both physically and mentally. \u2022 Provide boys with practical life-skill training, community volunteering and peer mentoring opportunities. \u2022 Raise awareness and understanding of the important role fathers play in the emotional, mental and educational development and well-being of boys. Why we do it: In 2013 the Centre for Social Justice published Fractured Families: Why stability matters, which highlighted an alarming trend of fatherlessness across the UK. It found that a teenager sitting their GCSEs is more likely to own a smartphone than live with their father, (only 57 per cent of 15-year olds are still living with their fathers while 62 per cent own a smartphone), (1). Nationally almost one quarter of families with dependent children are lone-parent families. (2) This figure rises significantly in our poorest neighbourhoods, and can be as high as 75 percent. (3) Blanden (2006) (4), found a father\u2019s low interest in his son\u2019s education, for instance, reduces his boy\u2019s chances of escaping poverty by 25% and at the more extreme end, 76% of all male prisoners in England and Wales had an absent father. Statistically males are the more vulnerable gender when it comes to alcohol and drug misuse, victims of murder, victims of suicide, homelessness. Lads Need Dads was set up to provide a preventative and early-intervention response to an ever-increasing social issue. Our services: \u2018EQUIP\u2019, is a six-month self-development group-work programme held in school including bush-craft and outdoor activities supported by a facilitator and a team of male mentors. Equips\u2019 aim is to help boys cope with problems and issues faced at home and school, and explore the important choices they face in their adolescent development, to prevent escalation of negative behaviour. Engage, a practical life-skill and community volunteering programme follows Equip and takes place in the community for six-months and involves boys attending practical life-skill workshops and together with thier mentors, doing voluntary work for lone parents, pensioners and people with a disability within their local community. Jobs include, DIY, painting and decorating, gardening, shed building, etc. Inspire, a peer mentoring programme incorporating inspirational speakers and visits to inspiring places, completes the 18-month programme. We have run the 18-month pilot once through between March 2016 and August 2017 with excellent outcomes. We started another Equip Programme in May this year. This ended this month (Nov) and the boys off this programme are now attending Engage, the second part of the programme. Alongside the programme we provide on-going support for mums and carers via workshops, coffee mornings and a face-book support group. We raise awareness within the community by giving talks and presentations to community groups, attending public events etc. We run an open-ended check-in group for graduates of the programme one evening a month to keep the arm of support in place, should they need it. We run a fishing club in the summer which is open to any boy on the programme, graduate or new boy who fits our criteria. We are just about to start a guitar club for boys who want to learn to play the guitar but who can't afford lessons. All our services are provided free of charge. We have a growing team of 14 male volunteer male mentors, between the ages of 29 and 70, from a wide range of backgrounds and from the local community. Our Director board is made up of four professionals from education, social care, statutory services and the voluntary sector. We are just entering into our next round of recruitment so anticipate our volunteer numbers increasing.

            "description": "In our Palestinian community where rates of childhood disability are very high, advocacy and human rights groups have been working diligently towards the integration of individuals with disability into society. By contrast, due to significant social, economic, and political barriers in access to research and in knowledge translation, research evidence is seldom used in the process of changing attitudes and practices. As the Palestinian Happy Child Center embarks on novel research programs in the area of genetics and early identification of developmental disability, the proposed project will build capacity in public engagement (PE) with research. Our project will contribute towards effective and continual knowledge translation of evidence, improving people's understanding and participation in research. Our goal is to enable and support centre users themselves to (1) formulate health research messages based on their unique and individual experiences and (2) communicate those messages to a wider audience. Through assessments inspired by previous research and interviews with family members, we will support families to better recognize the children's strengths. Parents will be offered the opportunity to create narratives aimed at helping other families and the widerpublic to demystify research and to explain complex findings about developmental disability. Our themes will focus on emerging understanding of how disability affects children differently and is often associated with unique skills. With these narratives in hand, we will reach out to the wider community (parents, relatives, teachers) with activities that will encourage better recognition of talents and promote change in attitudes and practices.",
